This is particularly true of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses over one thousand distinct bacterial species and an estimated excess of1.times.10.sup.14 microorganisms, and appears to be central in defining human host health status.  For example, the microbiome of the GI tract underlies central processes of nutrient capture and metabolism; however, disruption of this microbiome is alsobelieved to be causative of a number of disorders.', 'Indeed, antibiotics, often a frontline therapy to prevent deleterious effects of microbes on human health, can induce disruption in the microbiome, including in the GI tract, and lead to further disease.  For instance, it is often necessary toadminister oral antibiotics for the treatment of infections.  However, residual oral antibiotics beyond what is needed for eradication of an infection can alter the ecological balance of normal intestinal microbiota in the gut and lead to furtherdisease.', 'Therefore, there is a need for agents that prevent microbiome disruption by oral antibiotics while not reducing or eradicating the beneficial anti-infective effects of these antibiotics in a subject.', 'SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'Accordingly, the present invention provides compositions and methods for protecting the gastrointestinal microbiome of a subject.  In one aspect, methods for protecting the microbiome of the GI tract are provided in which an effective amount ofa pharmaceutical composition comprising a beta-lactamase is administered to a subject who is undergoing treatment of has recently undergone treatment with an oral antibiotic, wherein the beta-lactamase is capable of deactivating the oral antibiotic.  Inan embodiment, the beta-lactamase does not substantially interfere with the plasma levels of a systemically absorbed orally administered antibiotic.  In another embodiment, the beta-lactamase deactivates excess oral antibiotic residue excreted into theGI tract.  In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase deactivates residual active antibiotic that is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returned in active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation.  In certainembodiments, an initial and/or adjunctive therapy may be administered to the subject.  The initial and/or adjunctive therapy may be one or more of metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, rifaximin, charcoal-based binder/adsorbent, fecal bacteriotherapy,probiotic therapy, and antibody therapy.  In certain embodiments, the subject may have previously suffered from a microbiome-mediated disorder or may present with symptoms of recurrence of a microbiome-mediated disorder.', ""In various embodiments, the methods of the invention treat or prevent a microbiome-mediated disorder, such as an antibiotic-induced adverse effect, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, C. difficile-associated disease, ulcerativecolitis, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.  In an embodiment, the methods of the invention maintain the normal intestinal microbiota of a subject.  For instance, in some embodiments, the methods of the invention maintain a healthy balance(e.g. a healthy ratio and/or healthy distribution) of intestinal microbiota of a subject.  In another embodiment, the methods of the invention treat or prevent the overgrowth of one or more pathogenic microorganisms in the GI tract.  In a furtherembodiment, the methods of the inventions find use in treating or preventing a nosocomial infection and/or a secondary emergent infection."", 'In various embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated for GI tract delivery.  For example, the beta-lactamase may be enteric coated.  In an embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract in which itdeactivates residual or excess oral antibiotic (e.g. residual active antibiotic that is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returned in active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation).  In another embodiment, thebeta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in which it prevents a microbicidal activity of the residual or excess oral antibiotic.  In a further embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract in whichit does not substantially interfere with the systemic activity of the orally administered antibiotic.  In another embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract that is distal to the release and absorption of theorally administered antibiotic.  In various embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated for substantially uniform dissolution in the area of release in the GI tract.  In still further embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated formicroorganism-based release in the GI tract.', 'In various embodiments, methods of the present invention provide combination therapy including beta-lactamase and one or more additional therapeutic agents.  In an embodiment, a subject is administered with a beta-lactamase inhibitor thatreleases in the GI tract proximal to the beta-lactamase.', 'BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES', 'FIG. 1 shows a timeline of piglet dosing for the study of Example 1.', 'FIG. 2 shows amoxicillin levels in the pig serum from the study of Example 1.', 'FIG. 3 shows strain relative abundance percent similarity from the sequencing analysis of Example 1.

Administration of oralantibiotics often disrupts the ecological balance of normal intestinal microbiota due to residual unabsorbed antibiotics being excreted into the intestines (e.g., the distal small intestine and/or the large intestine).  Beta-lactamases inactivate theunabsorbed antibiotics in the GI tract thereby restoring and/or maintaining the normal intestinal microbiota and preventing any overgrowth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.', 'In some aspects, the present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that one or more beta-lactamases can be formulated to release in one or more locations within the GI tract at which the beta-lactamase inactivates (e.g. hydrolyzes) anorally delivered beta-lactam antibiotic and, in doing so, protects the microbiome, but the beta-lactamase does not interfere with intestinal absorption of the oral antibiotic and, accordingly, does not interfere with systemic blood or plasma levels ofthe oral antibiotic.  The invention further identifies the location of such beta-lactamase release or activation with preferred locations being in the ileum or cecum.  By way of illustration, in some embodiments, the following two approaches may beemployed separately or in combination: utilization of formulations designed to release beta-lactamase at the desired location in the GI tract and combining the antibiotic with an oral beta-lactamase inhibitor.  In the latter, in some embodiments, thebeta-lactamase inhibitor tracks with the beta-lactam antibiotic such that both are available for absorption in the proximal small intestine.  The beta-lactamase inhibitor serves to protect the beta-lactam antibiotic from the beta-lactamase in theproximal small intestine.  The antibiotic and the inhibitor are then both absorbed into the bloodstream and thereby removed from the proximal small intestine.  As the concentration of inhibitor decreases in the small intestine, the beta-lactamase becomesactive.  Any residual or excess antibiotic that remains in the intestine or reenters with the bile will is inactivated prior to encountering the colonic microbiome.', 'Beta-Lactamases and Pharmaceutical Compositions', 'The present invention is directed, in part, to pharmaceutical compositions, formulations, and uses of one or more beta-lactamases.  As used herein, a beta-lactamase refers to an enzyme, which deactivates beta-lactams.  For example, thebeta-lactamase may deactivate a beta-lactam by hydrolysis (e.g. hydrolysis of residual or excess antibiotic).  Hydrolysis of the amide bond of the beta-lactam ring by the beta-lactamase makes an antimicrobial agent such as an antibiotic biologicallyinactive.', 'In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to compositions including one or more beta-lactamase enzyme of class EC 3.5.2.6.  In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase is a group 1, 2, 3, or 4 beta-lactamase, in accordance with thefunctional classification scheme proposed by Bush et al. (1995, Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  39: 1211-1233; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).  Without wishing to be bound by theory, Group 1 beta-lactamases includecephalosporinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid; Group 2 includes penicillinases, cephalosporinases and broad-spectrum beta-lactamases that are generally inhibited by active site-directed beta-lactamase inhibitors; Group 3 includesmetallo-beta-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, and that are poorly inhibited by almost all beta-lactam-containing molecules; and Group 4 includes penicillinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid.', 'In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase is a class A, B, C, or D beta-lactamase, in accordance with the Ambler classification which divides beta-lactamases based on their amino acid sequences (Ambler 1980, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 289: 321-331; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).  Without wishing to be bound by theory, classes A, C, and D beta-lactamases include evolutionarily distinct groups of serine beta-lactamases, and class B include thezinc-dependent (""EDTA-inhibited"") beta-lactamases (see Ambler R.

However, the one or more beta-lactamase inhibitors do not have suchinhibitory effects on beta-lactamase activity lower in the GI tract (e.g. distal small intestine and/or the colon) and therefore allow the described beta-lactamase to deactivate (e.g. hydrolyze) residual or excess oral antibiotic lower in the GI tractand thus prevent or mitigate damage to the GI microbiota.', 'In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase inhibitor tracks with the beta-lactam antibiotic such that both are available for absorption in the proximal small intestine.  The beta-lactamase inhibitor serves to protect the beta-lactam antibiotic fromthe beta-lactamase in the proximal small intestine.  The antibiotic and the inhibitor are then both absorbed into the bloodstream and thereby removed from the proximal small intestine.

The stability of the delayed-release coating can be pHdependent.  Delayed-release coatings that are pH dependent will be substantially stable in acidic environments (pH of about 5 or less), and substantially unstable in near neutral to alkaline environments (pH greater than about 5).  For example, thedelayed-release coating may essentially disintegrate or dissolve in near neutral to alkaline environments such as are found in the small intestine (e.g. one or more of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) and/or large intestine (e.g. one or more of thececum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon).', 'By way of non-limiting example, there are various EUDRAGIT formulations that dissolve at rising pH, with formulations that dissolve at pH >5.5 (EUDRAGIT L30 D-550), pH >6.0 (EUDRAGIT L12, 5), and pH >7.0 (EUDRAGIT FS 30D).  Since theileum has the highest pH in the small intestine, ranging from 7.3 to 7.8, the use of EUDRAGIT FS 30D to coat the pellet containing the antibiotic-degrading enzyme, may delay the dissolution of the pellet until it reaches the ileum thereby localizing therelease of the antibiotic-degrading enzyme to the ileum.  However, the jejunum has a pH ranging from 6.6 to 7.4, therefore, the release may initiate in some patients in the jejunum, if the pH is at 7.0 or above.  In such embodiments, theantibiotic-degrading enzyme may be delivered with an antibiotic/inhibitor combination as described.  The different types of EUDRAGIT can be combined with each other, or multiple different types of EUDRAGIT coatings can be combined to fine tune thedissolution profile to achieve targeted delivery to achieve optimal function.  For example, EUDRAGIT L100, EUDRAGIT S100, and triethyl citrate may be mixed together at a ratio of, for example, about 72.7/18.2/9.1, to form a coating that substantiallyreleases at a pH of greater than about 6.2.  In another example, EUDRAGIT L100, EUDRAGIT S100, and triethyl citrate may be mixed together at a ratio of, for example, about 30/60.9/9, to form a coating that substantially releases at a pH of greater thanabout 6.7.  In a further example, DUOCOAT (KUECEPT) that uses two coatings of enteric polymers (like EUDRAGIT), an outer layer, and an inner layer of partially neutralized enteric polymer and a buffer agent.  The DUOCOAT technology allows more rapidrelease of the therapeutic agent initiated at the targeted pH compared to a single coating of the enteric polymer (Liu et al., 2010, European J. Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceuticals 47:311, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein byreference).  Release was demonstrated to be targeted to the ileum and/or ileoceacal junction in 10 healthy volunteers (Varum et al., 2013, European J. Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceuticals 84:573, the entire contents of all of which are incorporatedherein by reference).', 'In another embodiment, the delayed-release coating may degrade as a function of time when in aqueous solution without regard to the pH and/or presence of enzymes in the solution.  Such a coating may comprise a water insoluble polymer.  Itssolubility in aqueous solution is therefore independent of the pH.  The term ""pH independent"" as used herein means that the water permeability of the polymer and its ability to release pharmaceutical ingredients is not a function of pH and/or is onlyvery slightly dependent on pH.  Such coatings may be used to prepare, for example, sustained release formulations.  Suitable water insoluble polymers include pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic polymers that are substantially insoluble in aqueousmedia, e.g., water, independent of the pH of the solution.  Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, or cellulose ether-esters, i.e., a cellulose derivative in which some of the hydroxy groups on thecellulose skeleton are substituted with alkyl groups and some are modified with alkanoyl groups.  Examples include ethyl cellulose, acetyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, and the like.  Other examples of insoluble polymers include, but are not limited to,lacquer, and acrylic and/or methacrylic ester polymers, polymers or copolymers of acrylate or methacrylate having a low quaternary ammonium content, or mixture thereof and the like.  Other examples of insoluble polymers include EUDRAGIT RS.RTM., EUDRAGITRL.RTM., and EUDRAGIT NE.RTM..  Insoluble polymers useful in the present invention include polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl acetals, polyacrylic acid esters, butadiene styrene copolymers, and the like.  In one embodiment, colonic delivery is achieved by useof a slowly-eroding wax plug (e.g., various PEGS, including for example, PEG6000) or pectin.  In an embodiment, the present invention contemplates the use of a delayed-release coating that degrade as a function of time which comprises a swell layercomprising croscarmellos sodium and hydroxyproplycellulose.  In such embodiment, the formulation may further include an osmotic rupture coating that comprises ethylcellulose such as ethylcellulose dispersions.', 'Alternatively, the stability of the modified-release formulation can be enzyme-dependent.  Delayed-release coatings that are enzyme dependent will be substantially stable in fluid that does not contain a particular enzyme and substantiallyunstable in fluid containing the enzyme.  The delayed-release coating will essentially disintegrate or dissolve in fluid containing the appropriate enzyme.  Enzyme-dependent control can be brought about, for example, by using materials which release theactive ingredient only on exposure to enzymes in the intestine, such as galactomannans.  Also, the stability of the modified-release formulation can be dependent on enzyme stability in the presence of a microbial enzyme present in the gut flora.  Forexample, in various embodiments, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a microbial enzyme present in the gut flora.  In an embodiment, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a bacteria present in the small intestine.  In anotherembodiment, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a bacteria present in the large intestine.', 'In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations of the present invention are designed for immediate release (e.g. upon ingestion).  In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations may have sustained-release profiles, i.e.slow release of the active ingredient(s) in the body (e.g., GI tract) over an extended period of time.  In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations may have a delayed-release profile, i.e. not immediately release the active ingredient(s)upon ingestion; rather, postponement of the release of the active ingredient(s) until the composition is lower in the gastrointestinal tract; for example, for release in the small intestine (e.g., one or more of duodenum, jejunum, ileum) or the largeintestine (e.g., one or more of cecum, ascending, transverse, descending or sigmoid portions of the colon, and rectum).  For example, a composition can be enteric coated to delay release of the active ingredient(s) until it reaches the small intestine orlarge intestine.  In some embodiments, there is not a substantial amount of the active ingredient(s) of the present formulations in the stool.', 'In various embodiments, the modified release formulation is designed for release in the colon.  Various colon-specific delivery approaches may be utilized.  For example, the modified release formulation may be formulated using a colon-specificdrug delivery system (CODES) as described for example, in Li et al., AAPS PharmSciTech (2002), 3(4): 1-9, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  Drug release in such a system is triggered by colonic microflora coupled withpH-sensitive polymer coatings.  For example, the formulation may be designed as a core tablet with three layers of polymer.  The first coating is an acid-soluble polymer (e.g., EUDRAGIT E), the outer coating is enteric, along with an hydroxypropylmethylcellulose barrier layer interposed in between.  In another embodiment, colon delivery may be achieved by formulating the beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) with specific polymers that degrade in the colon such as, for example,pectin.  The pectin may be further gelled or crosslinked with a cation such as a zinc cation.  In an embodiment, the formulation is in the form of ionically crosslinked pectin beads which are further coated with a polymer (e.g., EUDRAGIT polymer). Additional colon specific formulations include, but are not limited to, pressure-controlled drug delivery systems (prepared with, for example, ethylcellulose) and osmotic controlled drug delivery systems (i.e., ORDS-CT).', 'Formulations for colon specific delivery of beta-lactamases (and/or additional therapeutic agents), as described herein, may be evaluated using, for example, in vitro dissolution tests.  For example, parallel dissolution studies in differentbuffers may be undertaken to characterize the behavior of the formulations at different pH levels.  Alternatively, in vitro enzymatic tests may be carried out.  For example, the formulations may be incubated in fermenters containing suitable medium forbacteria, and the amount of drug released at different time intervals is determined.  Drug release studies can also be done in buffer medium containing enzymes or rat or guinea pig or rabbit cecal contents and the amount of drug released in a particulartime is determined.  In a further embodiment, in vivo evaluations may be carried out using animal models such as dogs, guinea pigs, rats, and pigs.  Further, clinical evaluation of colon specific drug delivery formulations may be evaluated by calculatingdrug delivery index (DDI) which considers the relative ratio of RCE (relative colonic tissue exposure to the drug) to RSC (relative amount of drug in blood i.e. that is relative systemic exposure to the drug).  Higher drug DDI indicates better colon drugdelivery.  Absorption of drugs from the colon may be monitored by colonoscopy and intubation.', 'In various embodiments, the present formulation provide for substantial uniform dissolution of the beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) in the area of release in the GI tract.  In an embodiment, the present formulation minimizespatchy or heterogeneous release of the beta-lactamase.  For example, when releasing in the distal small intestine or, especially the colon, the distribution of beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) may be heterogeneous and thereforerequire formulation to minimize local effects.', 'In some embodiments, a dual pulse formulation is provided.  In various embodiments, the present invention provides for modified-release formulations that release multiple doses of the beta-lactamase, at different locations along the intestines,at different times, and/or at different pH.  In an illustrative embodiment, the modified-release formulation comprises a first dose of the beta-lactamase and a second dose of the beta-lactamase, wherein the first dose and the second dose are released atdifferent locations along the intestines, at different times, and/or at different pH.  For example, the first dose is released at the duodenum, and the second dose is released at the ileum.  In another example, the first dose is released at the jejunum,and the second dose is released at the ileum.  In other embodiments, the first dose is released at a location along the small intestine (e.g., the duodenum), while the second dose is released along the large intestine (e.g., the ascending colon).  Invarious embodiments, the modified-release formulation may release at least one dose, at least two doses, at least three doses, at least four doses, at least five doses, at least six doses, at least seven doses, or at least eight doses of thebeta-lactamase at different locations along the intestines, at different times, and/or at different pH.  Further the dual pulse description herein applies to modified-release formulations that release a beta-lactamase and an additional therapeutic agent.', 'In some embodiments, a dual pulse formulation is provided in which a dose of the beta-lactamase and a dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) are released at different locations along the intestines, at different times,and/or at different pH.  For example, the dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) is released proximal to the dose of the beta-lactamase.  For example, the dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) is releasedin the ileum and upstream and the dose of the beta-lactamase is released in the distal small intestine and/or the colon.', 'In various embodiments, the invention provides a formulation comprising: a core particle having a base coat comprising one or more beta-lactamases, and a delayed-release coating disposed over the coated core particle.

In one embodiment, one or more doses of the beta-lactamase may be encapsulated in a core particle, for example, in the formof a microsphere or a mini-sphere.  For example, the beta-lactamase may be combined with a polymer (e.g., latex), and then formed into a particulate, micro-encapsulated enzyme preparation, without using a sucrose core.  The microspheres or mini-spheresthus formed may be optionally covered with a delayed-release coating.', 'A variety of approaches for generating particulates (such as microspheres, mini-spheres, aggregates, other) may be utilized for the inclusion of enzymatic proteins.  They typically involve at least two phases, one containing the protein, and onecontaining a polymer that forms the backbone of the particulate.  Most common are coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water(w/o/w) emulsion where the inner water phase contains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form, forexample, microspheres or mini-spheres.  Alternatively, the beta-lactamase and stabilizing excipients (for example, trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol) are combined and sprayed from aqueous solution and collected.  The particles are thensuspended in a dry, water immiscible organic solvent containing polymer and release modifying compounds, and the suspension sonicated to disperse the particles.  An additional approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.  Specifically, theenzymatic protein, buffer components, a polymer latex, and stabilizing and release-modifying excipients are dissolved/dispersed in water.  The aqueous dispersion is spray-dried, leading to coalescence of the latex, and incorporation of the protein andexcipients in particles of the coalesced latex.  When the release modifiers are insoluble at acidic conditions but soluble at higher pHs (such as carboxylic acid) then release from the matrix is inhibited in the gastric environment.  In an embodiment,the beta-lactamase may be initially solubilized as an emulsion, microemulsion, or suspension and then formulated into solid mini-spheres or microspheres.  The formulation may then be coated with, for example, a delayed-release, sustained-release, orcontrolled-release coating to achieve delivery at a specific location such as, for example, the intestines.', 'In various embodiments, the formulation may comprise a plurality of modified-release particles or beads or pellets or microspheres.

There are a variety of approaches for generating particulates (such as microspheres,aggregates, other) that are amenable to the inclusion of proteins.  In some embodiments, the approaches involve at least two phases, one containing the protein, and one containing a polymer that forms the backbone of the particulate.  For example, one ormore of the following may be used: coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water (w/o/w) emulsion where the inner water phasecontains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form the microspheres.', 'In some embodiments, the protein and stabilizing excipients (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol) are combined and then the mixture is sprayed from aqueous solution and particles that are formed are collected.

It is anticipated that the enzyme will retain its activity following this process. Another approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.  Here, the enzyme, buffer components, a polymer latex, and stabilizing and release-modifying excipients are dissolved/dispersed in water.  The aqueous dispersion is spray-dried, leading tocoalescence of the latex, and incorporation of the protein and excipients in particles of the coalesced latex.

For example, coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water (w/o/w)emulsion where the inner water phase contains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form the microspheres maybe used.', 'In another approach, the protein and stabilizing excipients (e.g., hydroxyproplyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) type MF; Aquacoat (FMC), sodium stearyl fumarate; trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol, and/or others) arecombined and then the mixture from aqueous solution is sprayed, particles form and are collected.  The particles are then suspended in a dry, water immiscible organic solvent containing polymer and release modifying compounds, and the suspensionsonicated to disperse the particles.  Using this method, two formulations of P3A were developed (TABLES 7 and 8).  Notably, HPMCAS-MF was used as the pore forming reagent as it is water insoluble at low pH (i.e., forms a gel), and become water soluble athigh pH.  At least 80% P3A activity was recovered after dissolution of the P3A particles made using these formulations as measured by the CENTA chromatogenic assay (TABLES 7 and 8) (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy; 45:1868).', 'TABLE-US-00019 TABLE 7 P3A formulation 1 Amt (g) Component Item in 500 ml % Total % API P3A 2.50 0.5 9.77 Pore Former HPMCAS-MF 1.67 0.3 6.53 Matrix Aquacoat (FMC) 50.00 10.1 58.62 Lube Sodium-Stearyl 0.83 0.2 3.24 Fumarate Buffer SodiumHydrogen 0.59 0.1 2.31 Phosphate Protectant Trehalose 5.00 1.0 19.54 Water 440.00 88.8 Total Water 489.85 Total Solids 25.59 100.00 Solids in Matrix 30.00 Activity Recovered 82.00', 'TABLE-US-00020 TABLE 8 P3A formulation 2 Amt (g) Component Item in 500 ml % Total % API P3A 11.25 2.30 39.37 Pore Former HPMCAS-MF 1.50 0.30 5.25 Matrix Aquacoat (FMC) 50.00 10.00 52.49 Lube Sodium-Stearyl 0.33 0.10 1.14 Fumarate Buffer SodiumHydrogen 0.50 0.10 1.75 Phosphate Protectant Trehalose 0.00 0.00 0.00 Water 437.50 87.50 Total Water 472.50 Total Solids 28.58 100.00 Solids in Matrix 30.00 Activity Recovered 80.00', 'Another approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.

The hamstermodel has been referred to as ""the gold standard"" small animal model for the evaluation of the efficacy of a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against CDI.  CDI is induced in the hamsters using the following protocol.  Male GoldenSyrian hamsters, purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind.) are pretreated 5 days or 24 hours prior to infection with a single subcutaneous injection of clindamycin at 10 or 30 mg/kg to deplete the animal\'s microbiome and predispose them to C. difficileinfection.  As ampicillin is also a risk for C. difficile infection (Freeman and Wilcox, 1999; Microbes Infect.  1:377), oral Augmentin, sultamicillin, ampicillin and/or amoxicillin is used in place of clindamycin to predispose the animals to C.difficile infection.

On the day of infection, animals are inoculated by oral gavage with 10.sup.6 C. difficile (ATCC 43255) vegetative cellsper hamster.

No. 62/074,993, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.  Briefly, the P3A coding region is codon optimized for expression in the yeast, S. cerevasiae, modified to reduced DNA homologies, and evaluated forthe presence of N-linked glycosylation sites, synthesized and cloned into the yeast expression plasmid, pD1214 (DNA 2.0) that contains the strong, constitutive TEF promoter, and a selectable URA3+marker.  Different S. cerevasiae leader sequences thatfacilitate secretion are known and are utilized to mediate P3A secretion.  A series of S. cerevasiae secretion vectors are available which contain a panel of different leader sequences to facilitate secretion.  An exemplary secretion signal is the yeastmating factor alpha (MAT alpha) signal, which is a 89 amino acid sequence composed of the signal and the prosequence which is cleaved in the Golgi by Kex2, an endogenous yeast protease, to yield the mature, secreted protein.  The invertase and othersignal sequences are naturally cleaved during translocation and secretion of the protein by signal peptidase and do not require additional protease cleavage steps.', ""At least two strategies may be used to generate S. cerevasiae, substrain boulardii, transformants that secrete P3A.  One strategy is the production of a S. boulardii URA3 knockout strain to allow the use of the P3A expression plasmids thatcontain the URA3 selectable marker to generate transformants (non-integrated, containing the plasmids) to use in efficacy evaluation in rodents and/or pigs.  The S. boulardii URA3 knockout is generated using the CRISPR recombination system (DiCarlo etal, 2013, Nucleic Acids Res.  41:4436).  The S. boulardii strain, designation Sb48 (ATCC Product # MYA-796) submitted to ATCC by D. A. Stevens (McCullough et al., 1998; J. Clinical Microbiology, 36:2613) is used for these studies.  Three potentialwild-type Cas9 cleavage sites in the upstream region of the URA3 gene are identified and approximately 500 pb of the regions surrounding these target sites are sequenced to ensure the presence of the sites in this yeast strain.  A homology construct isdesigned that contains an approximate 10 bp region in the middle replaced by an insert that contains multiple stop codons in all frames ensuring that the first stop codon is in the URA3 reading frame.  The CRISPR system is used to create therecombination/insertion and the URA3-clones are selected on FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid) media.  5-FOA allows the selection for URA3-mutants, as an active URA3 gene (encodes orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase) converts FOA into a toxic compound causingcell death.  The selected clones are then tested to ensure that they will not grow on media without uracil.  Selected clones are sequenced to verify the expected integration.  Once the S. boulardii strain is confirmed to be URA3-, the yeast aretransformed with the P3A encoding plasmids.  Clones are identified by plating on media without uracil.  The resulting transformants are screened for secretion of P3A using SDS/PAGE.  Filtered yeast supernatants are evaluated for activity using the CENTAbeta-lactamase biological activity assay (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy., 45:1868)."", 'A second strategy generates stable integrants in the wild-type S. boulardii strain using a neomycin resistance gene (neo) as the selectable marker.

Clinical Microbiology, 36:2613) is used for these studies.  Integration regions are chosen based on Flagfeldt et al (2009, Yeast 26:545), where chromosomalintegration sites were screened for high level heterologous gene expression.  The integration sites that show the highest expression levels, Regions 20, 21, and 19 are sequenced in the wild-type S. boulardii strain to verify their presence.  Onceverified, a region is chosen and plasmids containing integration cassettes are designed.  The integration cassettes containing the P3A expression cassette, a neo expression cassette, at least 500 bp of homology sequence from the upstream part of theintegration region and at least 500 bp of homology sequence from the downstream part of the integration region so that the integration region is deleted via the homologous recombination event.  The wild-type S. boulardii is transformed with theintegration cassettes and clones are selected for G418 resistance.  Clones are picked, cultures grown, and supernatants screened for the presence of the P3A protein via SDS/PAGE.  Filtered yeast supernatants are evaluated for biological activity usingthe CENTA beta-lactamase biological activity assay (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemo., 45:1868).

Its ligand, PD-L1 (B7-H1/CD274), is expressed on antigen presentingcells and tumor cells.  Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor inhibits T cell activation and counterbalances T cell stimulatory signals, such as the binding of B7 to CD28.', 'PD-L1 is not expressed by normal epithelial tissues, but it is aberrantly expressed on a wide array of human cancers.  In this context, PD-L1 may promote cancer progression by disabling the host anti-tumor response.  Its expression on tumorcells has been associated with poorer prognosis in renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Multiple antibodies targeting PD-1 have been generated and showed efficacious in tumor growth and prolong overall survival in randomized controlled trials.  Several PD-L1 targeting antibodies have been discovered and showed activities ininhibiting tumor growth.  Because these antibodies are internalized by PD-L1 expressing cells and degraded in endosome and lysosome compartment quickly, these antibodies are quickly eliminated by PD-L1 expressing cells and thus the ability of theseantibodies to inhibit tumor growth is limited by the amount of antibodies delivered.  Sustained inhibition of tumor growth requires continuous infusion of large amount of antibodies to keep the concentration of antibody in the tumor site high enough toblock the activity of PD-L1.  Therefore the cost of providing these agents is expected to be very high as it requires injection of large amount of antibodies to the patient.  More importantly, the ability to achieve complete response will also belimited.  Thus, the generation of antibodies with significantly better efficacy than current anti-PD-L1 antibodies will be needed.', 'BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'The present disclosure provides novel monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibodies (in particular chimeric and humanized antibodies), polynucleotides encoding the same, methods of using the same and binding epitopes thereof on the human PD-L1 protein.', 'In certain embodiments, an isolated PD-L1 antibody is provided herein comprising heavy chain HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 and light chain LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 sequences, wherein', 'the HCDR1 sequence is TYWX.sub.1H (SEQ ID NO: 1) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'the HCDR2 sequence is MIQPNSGGTKYNX.sub.2X.sub.3FKX.sub.4 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'the HCDR3 sequence is GAGTVDYFDY (SEQ ID NO: 3) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'the LCDR1 sequence is RASESVDIYGNSFMH (SEQ ID NO: 4) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'the LCDR2 sequence is RASNLES (SEQ ID NO: 5) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'the LCDR3 sequence is X.sub.5QSX.sub.6X.sub.7DPYT (SEQ ID NO: 6) or a homologue sequence of at least 80% (e.g. at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity thereof;', 'wherein X.sub.1 is I or M; X.sub.2 is D or E; X.sub.3 is Q or K; X.sub.4 is N or K; X.sub.5 is Q or H; X.sub.6 is N or T; X.sub.7 is D or E.', 'In certain embodiments, X.sub.1 is I or M; X.sub.2 is D or E; X.sub.3 is Q or K; X.sub.4 is N or K; X.sub.5 is Q; X.sub.6 is N or T; X.sub.7 is D or E.

(2000) J. Exp.  Med.  192:1027).  It is expressed in placenta, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, heart, fetal liver,and is also found on many tumor or cancer cells.  ""PD-L2"" refers to programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2, see, for example, Latchman et al. (2001) Nat.  Immunol.  2:261).  ""PD-1"" (also known as CD279) refers to programmed cell death 1, a member of theCD28 family, is encoded by the PDCD 1 gene and is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of T cells which functions to physiologically limit T cell activation and proliferation.  Representative amino acid sequence of human PD-1 is disclosedunder the NCBI accession number: NP_005009.2, and the representative nucleic acid sequence encoding the human PD-1 is shown under the NCBI accession number: NM_005018.2.  The ""PD-1 ligand"" includes either or both PD-L1 and PD-L2 and any variants orisoforms which are naturally expressed by cells, and/or fragments thereof having at least one biological activity of the full-length polypeptides.  The sequence of human PD-L1 is disclosed under the NCBI accession number: NP_054862.1 (representativeamino acid sequence) and NCBI accession number: NM_014143.3 (representative nucleic acid sequence).', 'The term ""antibody"" as used herein includes any immunoglobulin, monoclonal antibody, polyclonal antibody, multivalent antibody, multispecific antibody, or bispecific (bivalent) antibody or a functional portion thereof that binds to a specificantigen.  A native intact antibody comprises two heavy chains (H) and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds.  Each heavy chain consists of a variable region (VH) and a first, second, and third constant region (CH1, CH2 and CH3,respectively), while each light chain consists of a variable region (VL) and a constant region (CL).  Mammalian heavy chains are classified as .alpha., .delta., .epsilon., .gamma., and .mu., and mammalian light chains are classified as .lamda.  or.kappa..  The variable regions of the light and heavy chains are responsible for antigen binding.  The variables region in both chains are generally subdivided into three regions of hypervariability called the complementarity determining regions (CDRs)(light (L) chain CDRs including LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3, heavy (H) chain CDRs including HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3).  CDR boundaries for the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments disclosed herein may be defined or identified by the conventions of Kabat,Chothia, or Al-Lazikani (Al-Lazikani, B., Chothia, C., Lesk, A. M., J. Mol. Biol., 273(4), 927 (1997); Chothia, C. et al., J Mol Biol.  December 5; 186(3):651-63 (1985); Chothia, C. and Lesk, A. M., J. Mol. Biol., 196,901 (1987); Chothia, C. et al.,Nature.  December 21-28; 342(6252):877-83 (1989); Kabat E. A. et al., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.  (1991)).  The three CDRs are interposed between flanking stretches known as framework regions (FRs), which are more highly conserved thanthe CDRs and form a scaffold to support the hypervariable loops.  Therefore, each VH and VL comprises of three CDRs and four FRs in the following order (amino acid residues N terminus to C terminus): FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.  The constantregions of the heavy and light chains are not involved in antigen binding, but exhibit various effector functions.  Antibodies are assigned to the five major classes based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chain: IgA, IgD,IgE, IgG, and IgM, which are characterized by the presence of .alpha., .delta., .epsilon., .gamma., and .mu.  heavy chains, respectively.  Subclasses of several of the major antibody classes are such as IgG1 (.gamma.1 heavy chain), IgG2 (.gamma.2 heavychain), IgG3 (.gamma.3 heavy chain), IgG4 (.gamma.4 heavy chain), IgA1 (.alpha.1 heavy chain), or IgA2 (.alpha.2 heavy chain).', 'As used herein, the term ""antigen-binding fragment"" refers to an antibody fragment formed from a fragment of an antibody comprising one or more CDRs, or any other antibody portion that binds to an antigen but does not comprise an intact nativeantibody structure.  In certain embodiments, the antibody provided herein is an antigen-binding fragment.  Examples of antigen-binding fragment include, without limitation, a diabody, a Fab, a Fab\', a F(ab\').sub.2, an Fv fragment, a disulfide stabilizedFv fragment (dsFv), a (dsFv).sub.2, a bispecific dsFv (dsFv-dsFv\'), a disulfide stabilized diabody (ds diabody), a single-chain antibody molecule (scFv), an scFv dimer (bivalent diabody), a multispecific antibody, a camelized single domain antibody, ananobody, a domain antibody, an isolated CDR and a bivalent domain antibody.  An antigen-binding fragment is capable of binding to the same antigen to which the parent antibody binds.  In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment may comprise oneor more CDRs from a particular human antibody.', '""Fab"" with regard to an antibody refers to a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of the antibody consisting of a single light chain (both variable and constant regions) bound to the variable region and first constant region of a single heavychain by a disulfide bond.  Fab can be obtained by papain digestion of an antibody at the residues proximal to the N-terminus of the disulfide bond between the heavy chains of the hinge region.', '""Fab\'"" refers to a Fab fragment that includes a portion of the hinge region, which can be obtained by pepsin digestion of an antibody at the residues proximal to the C-terminus of the disulfide bond between the heavy chains of the hinge regionand thus is different from Fab in a small number of residues (including one or more cysteines) in the hinge region.', '""F(ab).sub.2"" refers to a dimer of Fab\' that comprises two light chains and part of two heavy chains.', '""Fe"" with regard to an antibody refers to that portion of the antibody consisting of the second and third constant regions of a first heavy chain bound to the second and third constant regions of a second heavy chain via disulfide bond.  IgG andIgM Fc regions contain three heavy chain constant regions (second, third and fourth heavy chain constant regions in each chain).  It can be obtained by papain digestion of an antibody.  The Fc portion of the antibody is responsible for various effectorfunctions such as ADCC, and CDC, but does not function in antigen binding.', '""Fv"" with regard to an antibody refers to the smallest fragment of the antibody to bear the complete antigen binding site.  A Fv fragment consists of the variable region of a single light chain bound to the variable region of a single heavychain.  A ""dsFv"" refers to a disulfide-stabilized Fv fragment that the linkage between the variable region of a single light chain and the variable region of a single heavy chain is a disulfide bond.', '""Single-chain Fv antibody"" or ""scFv"" refers to an engineered antibody consisting of a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region connected to one another directly or via a peptide linker sequence (Huston J S et al. Proc NatlAcad Sci USA, 85:5879(1988)).  A ""scFv dimer"" refers to a single chain comprising two heavy chain variable regions and two light chain variable regions with a linker.  In certain embodiments, an ""scFv dimer"" is a bivalent diabody or bivalent ScFv (BsFv)comprising V.sub.H-V.sub.L (linked by a peptide linker) dimerized with another V.sub.H-V.sub.L moiety such that V.sub.H\'s of one moiety coordinate with the V.sub.L\'s of the other moiety and form two binding sites which can target the same antigens (oreptipoes) or different antigens (or eptipoes).  In other embodiments, a ""scFv dimer"" is a bispecific diabody comprising V.sub.H1-V.sub.L2 (linked by a peptide linker) associated with V.sub.L1-V.sub.H2 (also linked by a peptide linker) such that V.sub.H1and V.sub.L1 coordinate and V.sub.H2 and V.sub.L2 coordinate and each coordinated pair has a different antigen specificity.', '""Single-chain Fv-Fc antibody"" or ""scFv-Fc"" refers to an engineered antibody consisting of a scFv connected to the Fc region of an antibody.', '""Camelized single domain antibody,"" ""heavy chain antibody,"" ""nanobody"" or ""HCAb"" refers to an antibody that contains two V.sub.H domains and no light chains (Riechmann L. and Muyldermans S., J Immunol Methods.  December 10; 231(1-2):25-38(1999); Muyldermans S., J Biotechnol.  June; 74(4):277-302 (2001); WO94/04678; WO94/25591; U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,005,079).  Heavy chain antibodies were originally obtained from Camelidae (camels, dromedaries, and llamas).  Although devoid of light chains,camelized antibodies have an authentic antigen-binding repertoire (Hamers-Casterman C. et al., Nature.  June 3; 363(6428):446-8 (1993); Nguyen V K. et al. ""Heavy-chain antibodies in Camelidae; a case of evolutionary innovation,"" Immunogenetics.  April;54(1):39-47 (2002); Nguyen V K. et al. Immunology.  May; 109(1):93-101 (2003)).  The variable domain of a heavy chain antibody (VHH domain) represents the smallest known antigen-binding unit generated by adaptive immune responses (Koch-Nolte F. et al.,FASEB J. November; 21(13):3490-8.  Epub 2007 Jun.  15 (2007)).  ""Diabodies"" include small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, wherein the fragments comprise a V.sub.H domain connected to a V.sub.L domain in a single polypeptide chain(V.sub.H-V.sub.L or V.sub.L-V.sub.H) (see, e.g., Holliger P. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.  July 15; 90(14):6444-8 (1993); EP404097; WO93/11161).  The two domains on the same chain cannot be paired, because the linker is too short, thus, the domainsare forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain, thereby creating two antigen-binding sites.  The antigenbinding sites may target the same of different antigens (or epitopes).', 'A ""domain antibody"" refers to an antibody fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain.

A conformational epitope can comprise non-contiguous but spatially juxtaposed amino acid residues due to the three dimensional tertiary folding of a protein, wherein those residues directly contribute to the affinity of theinteraction and will lose the ability of interaction when exposed to denaturing solvents.  In contrast, all the points of interaction of a linear epitope are arranged linearly along the primary amino acid residues on the protein and the small segments ofthe contiguous amino acids can be digested from an antigen binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules or retained on exposure to denaturing solvents (Salmeron A et al., J Immunol.  1991 Nov.  1; 147(9):3047-52; Goldsby et al.,Immunology (Fifth ed.).

An ""alanine scanning mutagenesis"" is a method that can be performedfor identifying certain residues or regions of a protein that affect the interaction of the epitope with another compound or protein that binds to it.  A residue or group of target residues within the protein is replaced by a neutral or negativelycharged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine, or a conservative amino acid substitution).  Any mutation of the amino acid residues or codons encoding the same that reduces binding of the protein more than a threshold or reduces binding ofthe protein to the maximal degree than other mutations is likely to be within the epitope bound by the protein.

The antigen binding exhibited by the pH-dependent antibodies at physiological neutral pH(i.e. pH 7.4) is greater than acidic pH 5.5 or 6.0 (e.g. at endosomal pH).  Such pH-dependent antibodies preferentially dissociate from the antigen in the endosome.  This can increase antibody halflife when the antigen undergoes antigen-mediatedclearance, because the pH-dependent antibody can escape the antigen-mediated degradation in the lysozome by dissociating from the antigen in endosome and recycling out of the cell.  Advantages of the pH-dependent antibodies include lower dosage of thetherapeutic pH-dependent antibody (no more than 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% or 10% of the dosage that would otherwise be required for a reference PD-L1 antibody to achieve a comparable in vivo therapeutic effect) or less dosing frequency due to theimproved recyclability and enhanced serum half-life, as compared to a reference PD-L1 antibody, both of which achieve a comparable in vivo therapeutic effect.  The reference antibody is non-pH dependent, such that it binds to PD-L1 similarly at bothacidic and neutral pH and has a similar binding at neutral pH as compared to the pH-dependent antibodies.

Different host cells have various characteristic and mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products.  Therefore, suitable cell lines can be chosen as host cells to ensure thecorrect modification and processing (such as primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation) of the antibody expressed.

If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a firststep, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration.  Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to theperiplasmic space of E. coli.  Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation.  Where the antibody and theantigen-binding fragments thereof are secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pelliconultrafiltration unit.  A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.', 'The antibody prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, reverse-phase chromatography, absorption chromatography, filtration, ultrafiltration, solvent precipitation,solvent extraction, distillation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dialysis, DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, salting out, immnoprecipitation, isoelectric focusing, recrystallization and affinitychromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique.  The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody.  Protein Acan be used to purify antibodies that are based on human .gamma.1, .gamma.2, or .gamma.4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., J. Immunol.  Meth.  62:1-13 (1983)).  Examples of protein A columns include Hyper D, POROS, and Sepharose FF (GE HealthcareBiosciences).  Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human .gamma.3 (Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:1567 1575 (1986)).  The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available.  Mechanicallystable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose.  Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX.TM.  resin (J. T.Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification.  Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparinSEPHAROSE.TM.  chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.', 'Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferablyperformed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).', 'Kits', 'The present disclosure provides kits comprising the anti-PD-L1 antibodies or the antigen-binding fragments thereof, or the pharmaceutical composition comprising the anti-PD-L1 antibodies or the antigen-binding fragments thereof provided herein.

Examples of cytokine therapy include, without limitation, interferons such as interferon-.alpha., -.beta., and .gamma., colony stimulating factors such as macrophage-CSF, granulocyte macrophage CSF, andgranulocyte-CSF, insulin growth factor (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), interleukins such IL-1, IL-la, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, andIL-12, tumor necrosis factors such as TNF-.alpha.  and TNF-.beta.  or any combination thereof.  Agents that inactivate immunosuppressive targets can also be used, for example, IL-1-antagonist (IL-1A), VEGFR2 antagonist (e.g. Vatalanib, Sunitinib,Sorafenib, Pazopanib), TGF-beta inhibitors, FGFR antagonist, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) antagonist (e.g. Imatinib, Sunitinib, Sorafenib, Pazopanib), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB) antagonist (e.g. Gefitinib, Lapatinib,Canertinib), IL-10 inihibitors, and Fas ligand inhibitors, or any combination thereof.  Another group of agents include those that activate immune responsiveness to tumor or cancer cells, for example, those enhance T cell activation (e.g. agonist of Tcell costimulatory molecules such as CTLA-4, ICOS and OX-40), and those enhance dendritic cell function and antigen presentation.', 'Screening and Evaluating the In Vivo Efficacy of Anti-PD-L1 Antibody', 'In order to screen and/or evaluate the in vivo efficacy (e.g. binding activity or binding affinity) of the PD-L1 antibody or the antigen-binding fragments thereof, a non-human tumor cell that expresses the human PD-L1 protein being inoculatedinto a non-human animal is generated.  In certain embodiments, the non-human tumor cell is a rodent (e.g. mouse, rat, or hamster, etc) cell.  In certain embodiments, the non-human tumor cell is a melanoma cell line (B16) or a mouse colon cancer cell line(MC38).  The non-human tumor cell can comprise a polynucleotide encoding the human PD-L1 protein with inactivation of the endogenous non-human PD-L1 gene segment.  The inactivation of the target gene can be caused by gene disruption of the protein-codingsequence, mutation, addition, gene silencing (e.g. RNAi gene antisense) or gene deletion (e.g. partially or entirely deletion of the coding sequence, or the coding sequence including flanking regions) at the endogenous gene locus, thereby eliminating orminimizing the expression of the non-human target gene or generating a functionally inactive/truncated polypeptide that is not bound by its ligands.  The flanking region of the encoding sequence can be within the range of about 1 bp to about 500 bp atboth the 5\' and 3\' ends, or the flanking region can be larger than 500 bp but will not include inactivation of other genes according to the disclosure.  ""Gene disruption"" as used herein refers to addition of one or more nucleotides or amino acids to thenaturally occurring sequence.  The gene disruption can be addition or insertion of a marker/reporter gene into the protein-coding sequence.  In certain embodiments, the inactivation is non-revertible.  In certain embodiments, inactivation results in acell having no detectable activity for the target gene or gene product.  The inactivation of a target gene is performed using suitable means in the art, for example, homologous recombination, RNA interference (RNAi) or CRISPR/Cas9 system.  In certainembodiments, the human PD-L1 gene segment encoding the human PD-L1 protein is operably inserted into the endogenous non-human PD-L1 gene locus (gene replacement).  In certain embodiments, the inserted polynucleotide encoding the human PD-L1 is integratedin a random, non-specific location (gene augmentation).  In yet further embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the human PD-L1 can be stably maintained in the cell as episomes, e.g. in the form of a separate, episomal segment of DNA, and thereplication of the episomal DNA is independent of or in synchronization with the host cell cycle.', 'The non-human tumor cells with complete inactivation of the target gene can be identified by FACS analysis of the cell surface expression or detecting the target gene transcription.  The polynucleotide encoding the human PD-L1 protein can beintroduced into the tumor cell, by any suitable method known in the art, such as homologous recombinant and transgenic method, via any suitable expression vector as described in the present disclosure (such as a lentivirus vector).

As used herein, the ""tumor burden"" is the amount of tumor cells in an individual that can be determined by the tumorvolume, number, or weight.  A tumor cell can be a solid tumor cell or non-solid tumor cell (such as hematologic cells).  The tumor cell can be a human tumor cell or a non-human tumor cell.  In certain embodiments, the tumor cell is inoculated into asyngenic non-human animal to generate a syngenic tumor model.  In certain embodiments, the tumor cell is cultured several passages before being inoculated into the non-human animal.  In certain embodiments, the non-human animal has a human-immune system.

When antibody labeled with this dye is internalized into intracellular endosomes (pH6.0-6.5) and lysosomes (4.5-5.5), high fluorescent signal can be detected.  Specifically,MC38-hPD-L1 cells (MabSpace) were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone).  Log phase growing cells were collected by centrifuging and cells were seeded at a density of 2.times.104/well (50 .mu.l/well) into 96-well plate toallow cells to adhere for overnight.  Then 2 .mu.g/ml goat anti-human-Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat #109-005-098) labeled with pHAb Amine Reactive Dye (25 .mu.l/well) was added into each wells followed by adding serially diluted 23F11-H4L4 or hIgG1 (25.mu.l/well) into each wells.  The antibodies are allowed to incubate with the cells for 6 hrs or 24 hrs at 37.degree.  C. After the end of incubation the culture medium was removed and 100 .mu.l PBS was added to each well.  The signal of the antibody ineach well of the plate was determined using Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific) by reading at spectrum of Ex 532 nm/Em 560 nm.  The data in graph showed that there is significant increase in fluorescent signal in the cells after 6 or 24 hours in aconcentration dependent manner.  These results demonstrated that 23F11-H4L4 can be efficiently internalized upon binding to hPD-L1 on the surface of MC38/hPD-L1 cells (see FIG. 35).', 'Example 26: Binding of Humanized PD-L1 Antibody to Activated T Cells In Vitro', 'Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from a leukapheresis pack using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in PBS plus 2% FBS.

Anti-human CD28 (BD, Cat #555725) was added to each well and then the cells are then cultured in 6-well plate with RPMI1640 plus 10% FBS for 3 days at 37.degree.  C. After that, the cells are collected and placed into 96-well round bottom plate in FACS buffer (PBS+5% BSA).  After centrifuge and the supernatants were discarded, serially diluted 23F11-H4L4 antibody, orhIgG1 with N297A mutation as negative control were added.  The plates were incubated for one hour at 4.degree.  C., then the cells were washed for three times using PBS.  Afterwards, 2.5 then the cells were washed for three times using PBS.

To further evaluate whether there would be anydifference of the antibody treatment in the MC38/hPD-L1 syngeneic model if the mouse PD-1 is changed to hPD-1, a situation existing in human patients, we implanted the MC38/hPD-L1 tumor cells into a PD-1 knock-in mice.  Specifically, the MC38/hPD-L1tumor cells were maintained in vitro as a monolayer culture in RPMI1640 medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (ExCell Biology), 100U/ml penicillin and 100 .mu.g/ml streptomycin (Hyclone) at 37.degree.

Field of the Invention', 'The present invention relates generally to a disposable vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product.  In particular, the present invention relates to an aqueous stable foam containing a surfactant which can be dispensed to bathroom tissue or the likefor application to the vaginal or anal area.', '2.  Background', 'Conventional vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe products are typically in the form of pre-wetted, non-flushable cloths or pads.  Because these products are pre-wetted with a volatile wiping agent, it is necessary to package and store these products insealed containers, jars, foil packets or the like in order to maintain moisture by reducing evaporation of the wiping agent.  For example, Tucks brand hemorrhoidal wipes are typically stored in a screw-top jar.  Due to the nature of conventional vaginaland/or hemorrhoidal wipe products and their storage requisites, a number of problems arise.', 'First, containers, jars, foil packets and the like, which are capable of storing a volatile wiping agent such as isopropyl alcohol, witch hazel, water or perfume, useful as a vaginal and/or hemorrhoidal wipe, are expensive.  Second, there is noprecise control over the amount of wiping agent dispensed with each pre-wetted cloth or pad, thereby leading to waste of the wiping agent.  Third, the pre-wetted cloths or pads are not readily disposable, i.e., they are not biodegradable and can not orshould not be flushed in a toilet.  Fourth, the need for bulky storage containers, jars, foil packets and the like precludes portability of vaginal and/or hemorrhoidal wipe products and/or hinders their disposal.  Finally, wipe products that are storedin conventional jars or dispensing wipe packets typically dry out before all of the wipes are used.', 'Hence, it is clear that there is a need for a readily disposable vaginal and/or hemorrhoidal wipe product which addresses the above-described problems.', 'SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'The present invention is directed to a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition capable of forming a stable foam suitable for use as a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe agent comprising (a) water; (b) at least one surfactant; and (c) at least onefoam stabilizing agent.', 'The present invention is also directed to a system for delivering a foam suitable for use as a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe agent, which comprises a propellantless dispenser containing the propellant-free foamable aqueous composition according tothe present invention.', 'The present invention is also directed to a stable foam suitable for use as a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe agent formed by dispensing from a propellantless dispenser the propellant-free foamable aqueous composition according to the presentinvention.', 'The present invention is also directed to a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product comprising the stable foam of the present invention disposed on bathroom tissue.', 'Still further, the present invention includes a foam wipe kit comprising (a) a propellantless finger actuated mechanical pump dispenser containing a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition capable of forming a stable foam on dispensing; and(b) a disposable substrate, such as bathroom tissue, for receiving the stable foam.', 'BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS', 'FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the F2 Finger Pump Foamer.TM.  suitable for use in the present invention.', 'DETAILED DESCRIPTION', 'The present invention is directed to a readily disposable vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product.  As used herein, the terms ""wipe product"" and ""wiping agent"" are used interchangeably with ""cleansing product"" and ""cleansing agent"".  In particular,the present invention relates to an aqueous stable foam containing at least one surfactant and at least one foam stabilizing agent which can be dispensed to bathroom tissue or the like for application to the vaginal or perineal area.', 'One of the advantages of such a foam is that a disposable vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product is achieved without the use of a foil packet, a Tucks brand jar or a diaper wipe container.  Advantageously, a desired amount of foam may be appliedand removed using several pieces of bathroom tissue, which is readily available, biodegradable and easily flushed.  As employed herein, bathroom tissue includes toilet paper or any other natural or synthetic product, such as Kleenex brand tissue,generally present in bathrooms or rest areas for sanitary or other purposes.', 'The foam of the present invention is stable.  For purposes of this invention, a stable foam may be generally defined as a non-irritating dry, relatively firm foam with low solids content which forms foam bubbles with a low contact angle withbathroom tissue and which maintains the integrity of the bathroom tissue.  A relatively low concentration of skin-compatible surfactants and water soluble foam stabilizers present in the wipe agent of the present invention produces a high void-containingor light density foam which barely, if at all, wets the bathroom tissue so that the tissue maintains its integrity during application of the wipe agent composition to the anal and/or vaginal mucosal surfaces.', 'In other words, the foam remains for an extended period of time, unless and until applied onto a surface with pressure such as by rubbing and/or with increasing temperature.  The pressure and/or increased temperature causes the foam to collapse,thus making the wipe agent(s) available to clean and/or medicate the tissues so treated.  As a result, the present foam can be applied to bathroom tissue or like substrate, without being absorbed by such.  The foam-carrying substrate can then be appliedto the vaginal or anal area.', 'In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition capable of forming a stable foam suitable for use as a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe agent.  This aqueous composition is charged into apropellantless foam dispenser to form the foam of the present invention for use in a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product.', 'The propellant-free foamable aqueous composition of the present invention comprises water, at least one surfactant and at least one foam stabilizing agent.', 'Water, preferably deionized water, is typically present in the propellant-free foamable aqueous composition in an amount from about 70% to about 98% by weight, preferably from about 80% to about 98% by weight, and most preferably about 90% byweight.  Unless otherwise indicated, all ingredient weight % are based on the total weight of the propellant-free foamable aqueous composition.', 'In general, in order to provide an enhanced stable foam according to the present invention, water-soluble compounds are preferably employed.  Such compounds are storage stable and readily dispensed by a propellantless mechanical pump.', 'Any type of compatible surfactant, e.g., nonionic, anionic, amphoteric, suitable for use in human hygienic products is suitable for use in the present invention.  The surfactant should be capable of forming a foam when mixed with air in a fingeractuated, mechanical pump foamer.  Such surfactants include, without limitation, those which do not irritate mucous membranes such as polyethylene 20 cetyl ether (Brij 58).TM., a nonionic surfactant; sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (Hamposyl L-30).TM., sodiumlauryl sulfoacetate (Lathanol LAL).TM.  and sodium laureth sulfate (Sipon ESY).TM.--anionic surfactants; lauramidopropyl betaine (Monateric LMAB).TM., an amphoteric surfactant, as well as polysorbate 20, TEA-cocoyl glutamate, disodium cocoamphodiacetateand combinations thereof.  Typically, the surfactant is present in the instant invention in an amount from about 2% to about 35% by weight, and preferably from about 5% to about 15% by weight.', 'According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a blend of Tween 20, Amisoft CT-12 and Monateric CDX 38 Mod.  (polysorbate 20, TEA-cocoyl glutamate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, respectively) is employed.  In this embodiment, Tween20 is present in an amount ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, preferably about 1%; Amisoft is present in an amount ranging from about 1% to about 15%, preferably about 5%; and Monateric is present in an amount ranging from about 1% to about 15%,preferably about 5%.', 'At least one foam stabilizing agent is also present in the foamable aqueous composition of the present invention.  Suitable foam stabilizing agents include, without limitation, natural or synthetic gums such as xanthan gum, polyalkylene glycolssuch as polyethylene glycol, alkylene polyols such as glycerine and propylene glycol and combinations thereof.  Typically, the foam stabilizers are present in an amount from about 0.10% to about 5%, preferably about 2% to about 4%.', 'In general, alkylene polyols are typically employed in amounts from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 3% to about 5%; gums are employed in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to about 1%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.15%;and/or polyalkylene glycols are present in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to about 2%.', 'Preservatives may also be present in the foamable aqueous composition of the present invention.  Suitable preservatives include, without limitation, methylparaben, propylparaben, Glydant Plus (DMDM hydantoin and iodopropynyl butylcarbamate) andcombinations thereof.  Typically, preservatives are present in an amount from about 0.10% to about 1%, preferably from about 0.40% to about 0.60%, and most preferably about 0.50%.', 'In certain embodiments of the present invention, namely the foamable aqueous composition suitable for use in a hemorrhoidal wipe product, water soluble medicaments may also be present.  Suitable medicaments include, without limitation, pramoxineHCl, phenylephrine HCl, ephedrine sulfate, dibucaine HCl and combinations thereof.  Typically, such medicaments are present in conventional amounts.', 'Other constituents normally found in vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe products may be present in the foamable aqueous composition of the present invention, if desired.  Such constituents typically include, but are not limited to, lubricants such asCetiol HE (PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate), chelating agents such as disodium EDTA, moisturizers such as aloe powder, healing agents such as vitamin E acetate (tocopherol acetate), fragrance, color and mixtures thereof.', 'One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that a particular ingredient may serve more than one function in the foamable aqueous composition of the present invention.  For example, disodium cocoamphodiacetate functions not only asa surfactant but also as a foam stabilizer.', 'Another embodiment of the present invention is a system for delivering a foam suitable for use in a vaginal or hemorrhoidal wipe product comprising a propellantless dispenser containing a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition of theinvention.  Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a stable foam formed by dispensing from a propellantless dispenser a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition as described above.', 'According to the present invention, the stable foam of the present invention is produced using a propellantless mechanical pump.  Such a pump precisely mixes water and air upon actuation to produce foam.  While it may be possible to use aconventional mechanical foam dispenser, such as a squeeze foamer, best results have been achieved with a mousse-type foam dispensing finger actuated dispenser.', 'Preferably, the foam is produced using the F2 Finger Pump Foamer.TM.  manufactured by AirSpray International Inc.  of Pompano Beach, Fla.  Such a spring-loaded valve system operates without the use of gas propellants or the like.  Upon actuation,precise amounts of air and liquid are mixed, and a foam capable of maintaining its structure for a substantial length of time is dispensed.  In addition, the dispenser can deliver a variable amount of foam, thereby reducing waste of the wipe agentcontained therein.', 'The F2 Finger Pump Foamer.TM.  is similar in design and operation to conventional propellantless finger actuated mechanical pump foamers, such as those described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,443,569, issued on Aug.  22, 1995, and U.S.  Pat.  No.5,813,576, issued Sep. 29, 1998, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.  Such propellantless finger actuated mechanical foamers can be employed to dispense the stable foam of the present invention.', 'A schematic diagram of the F2 Finger Pump Foamer.TM.  is provided in FIG. 1 in which a dip tube 10 receives the foamable aqueous composition contained in a container body (not shown).  A pump head 12 moves up and down to dispense the foam.  Anair piston 14 and liquid piston 16 are concentrically arranged and are urged upwardly by spring 18.  A gasket seal 20, air cylinder 22, liquid cylinder 24, ball 26, plug 28, inner rod 30, and valve 32 are arranged as shown in FIG. 1 and operate generallyin accordance with the corresponding elements of FIG. 1 of U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,443,569, incorporated by reference, and especially described in columns 12-14, thereof.  In general, as the air piston and liquid piston are moved down upon actuation, the airand liquid-containing chambers are pressurized.  Pressurized foamable liquid in the liquid chamber and pressurized air are mixed to produce the foam, which is homogenized into a finer foam by mesh and net members 34 after which the foam is dispensed fromthe nozzle tip.  A basecap 36 is attached to the external cylinder just below the nozzle and an overcap 38 protects the nozzle.', 'The F2 Finger Pump Foamer.TM.  is an easy-to-use dispenser, with excellent performance, and provides clean, single stroke action, zero-VOC formulations and high foam quality.  Shaking the container will not affect foam quality.  Precise dosageper stroke is possible, and the container is refillable.', 'A', 'Synbio', 'Dual Chambered Dispenser.TM.  may also be utilized as the propellantless dispenser.', 'The aerosol type foam dispenser which employs gas propellant is inconvenient to use and produces an unsatisfactory foam compared to that produced by the present invention.  Further, once the propellant volatilizes, the foam produced using anaerosol type foam dispenser collapses.', 'A further embodiment of the present invention is directed to a foam wipe kit.  The foam wipe kit comprises (a) a propellantless finger actuated mechanical pump dispenser containing a propellant-free foamable aqueous composition capable of forminga stable foam on dispensing; and (b) a disposable substrate, such as bathroom tissue, for receiving the stable foam.', 'The following non-limiting examples further illustrate the present invention.', 'EXAMPLE 1', 'A foamable aqueous composition and a foam were prepared by combining the ingredients listed in Table 1 according to the below-described method.', 'TABLE 1  Ingredient Weight %  polysorbate 20 (100% active).sup.1 1.00  TEA-cocoyl glutamate (30% active).sup.2 5.00  disodium cocoamphodiacetate (38% 5.00  active).sup.3  propylene glycol 3.00  xanthan gum.sup.4 0.10  triclosan 0.25  perfume0.10  DMDM hydantoin and iodopropynyl 0.25  butylcarbamate.sup.5  deionized water 85.24  vitamin E acetate (tocopherol 0.05  acetate)  aloe powder 0.01  .sup.1 sold as Tween 20 .TM. by ICI Surfactants  .sup.2 sold as Amisoft CT-12 .TM. by Ajinomoto .sup.3 sold as Monateric CDX .TM. 38 Mod. by Mona  .sup.4 sold as Xantural 180 .TM. by Monsanto  .sup.5 sold as Glydant Plus .TM. by Lonza', 'Triclosan was added to propylene glycol in a small container using a propeller mixer.  The mixture was mixed and heated slightly until all solids dissolved.  Xanthan gum was mixed with deionized water in a large container using a propeller mixer. Aloe powder was added to the aqueous composition with mixing.  Polysorbate 20, TEA-cocoyl glutamate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, vitamin E acetate and DMDM hydantoin and iodopropynyl butylcarbamate were added to the aqueous mixture with mixing.  Thecontents of both the small and the large container were combined and mixed.  Perfume was added to the mixture.

Many commercial products of Bifidus bacteria are available in forms of variousfermented milk drinks and foods or live bacterial preparations, establishing a firm market.  In particular, the fermented milk drinks and foods containing bifidus bacteria have favorable taste and are fit for continuous ingestion of bifidus bacteria.', 'With recent progress on the study of the effectiveness of bifidus bacteria, it was found that the bifidus bacteria have an anti-ulcer effect; for example, it has been reported that 3 species of Bifidobacterium breve YIT 4014, Bifidobacteriumbreve YIT 4043 and Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007 (FERM BP-791) show an anti-ulcer effect in a rat model with ulcer induced by acetic acid (non-patent document 1).  In addition, it has been reported that by administering Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT4007 in dried powder form, the condition of patients suffering from gastric ulcer or duodenum ulcer is improved and Helicobacter pylori disappear from the gastric mucosa (non-patent document 2).  Thus, utilization of the bifidus bacteria has beenexpected as a preventive or therapeutic agent for infection with Helicobacter pylori or as a preventive or therapeutic agent for gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenum ulcer.  Further, it has been reported that the effect of the above-mentionedBifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007 increases in accordance with the increase in the viable cell count to be administered (non-patent document 3).  In order to make effective use of the pharmacological action of Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007, it isnecessary to allow as many live cells as possible to reach the stomach and intestinal tract.', 'The bifidus bacteria including Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007 are sensitive to oxygen since they are obligatory an aerobes; particularly, when preserved under aerobic condition, a problem arises that they are rapidly reduced in the viable cellcount; therefore, it was difficult to administer the sufficient number of bifidus bacteria.', 'In order to solve this problem, an attempt is being made to make use of various components for improving the survivability in preservation, such as, vegetable juice of pumpkin, cucumber, etc., pyruvic acid, reduced-type glutathione (patentdocument 1), glycerol, xylitol, etc. (patent document 2), lactitol (patent document 3), and the like.  The addition of these components, however, involves problems such as increase in the production cost, decrease in taste, and the like and thus cannotbe readily applied.  Another attempt is being made to place a fermented product containing a bifidus bacterium in a vessel composed of oxygen-impermeable wrapping material to completely block contact with oxygen.  However, such vessel with perfectoxygen-impermeability has not yet been provided, and further there is a problem that materials having low oxygen-permeability are poor in molding flexibility.  Moreover, when a composite material is used for a vessel composed of low oxygen-permeablematerial, problems arise such as treatment of its waste is complicated, the vessel is per se expensive and the like, and thus there is much limitation in its utilization.', 'It is considered, accordingly, that an ultimate solution for improving the survivability of the bifidus bacteria in fermented milk drinks and foods etc., is to create a strain of bifidus bacteria having high survivability even in aerobiccondition; as examples of such bacterial strains, Bifidobacterium breve YIT 10001 (FERM BP-8205)(patent document 4), Bifidobacterium breve SBR3212 (FERM P-11915) (patent document 5), Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4002 (FERM BP-1038) (patent document 6),and the like are already been reported.', 'These bifidus bacteria having high survivability in aerobic condition, however, exhibited much lower activity of killing Helicobacter pylori and antiulcer activity compared to Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007.

Further, Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention can preferably be utilized in production of drinks and foods having the above-mentioned preventive or therapeutic effect,particularly fermented milk drink and food, and is not necessary to be put in a vessel made of an oxygen-impermeable wrapping material; thus, options of the vessels are broad.', 'BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION', 'Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention has an effect of killing Helicobacter pylori and shows a survival rate of 10% or higher in the case of being present in a fermented milk drink or food and stored under aerobic condition at 10.degree.  C.for 14 days.  The term ""effect of killing Helicobacter pylori"" indicates that the cell number of Helicobacter pylori decreases due to an inhibitory action for adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric cell or a direct inhibitory action for thegrowth of Helicobacter pylori.  As described herein, the inhibitory action for adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric cell specifically means that when Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention is added to the cells derived from the humanstomach on a Leibovitz\'s L-15 medium at a rate of 10.sup.8-10.sup.9 CFU/mL and pre-incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 2 hours, and Helicobacter pylori is added there at 10.sup.7 CFU/mL and incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 90 minutes and allowed to stand at4.degree.  C. overnight, then the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric cell is inhibited by 5% or more, preferably by 5-20%.  Alternatively, it may mean that when 10.sup.7 CFU/mL of Helicobacter pylori and 10.sup.8-10.sup.9 CFU/mL ofBifidobacterium bifidum of the invention are pre-incubated on a Leibovitz\'s L-15 medium at 37.degree.  C. for 2 hours, and the pre-incubated solution is added to the cells derived from the human stomach and incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 90 minutes andallowed to stand at 4.degree.  C. overnight, then the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric cell is inhibited by 5% or more, preferably by 5-20%.  The inhibitory action for the growth of Helicobacter pylori specifically means that when10.sup.5 CFU/mL of Helicobacter pylori and 10.sup.7 CFU/mL of Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention are added to a Brucella medium and incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 48 hours, the live cell number of Helicobacter pylori is reduced to 10.sup.3 CFU/mLor less, preferably 10-10.sup.3 CFU/mL.  Decrease of the cell number of Helicobacter pylori specifically refers to the reduced number of the cells of Helicobacter pylori adhering to gastric cell, gastric mucin or gastric tissue, the reduced number of thecells of Helicobacter pylori existing in the intestinal tract such as oral cavity, nasal cavity, throat, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, appendix, large intestine, rectum, and the like, the reduced number of the cells of Helicobacterpylori in concurrent incubation (mixed culture) with Helicobacter pylori, decrease of the .DELTA..sup.13CO.sub.2 value in an urea breath test, decrease of the antibody titer for Helicobacter pylori in serum, and decrease of the antigen amount forHelicobacter pylori in feces.  In this connection, the cell number of Helicobacter pylori includes the live cell number (CFU) of Helicobacter pylori, the amount of cell (reactivity with an anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody), the amount of gene (theamount of DNA or RNA capable of recognizing specifically Helicobacter pylori), the amount or activity of an pathogenic factor specific to Helicobacter pylori (urease activity, vacuolation toxin VacA, CagPAI (pathogenecity island), the amount of LPS-Lewisantigen).  Further, the survival rate refers to the ratio of the viable cell count of a culture broth or a fermented milk drink or food after storage under aerobic condition (10.degree.  C., 14 days) to the viable cell count before storage under aerobiccondition.  The viable cell count can be obtained according to a conventional method.  For example, a culture broth or a fermented milk drink or food described later which has been used in storage under aerobic condition is diluted properly, and thensmeared on or mixed in a TOS propionic acid agar medium, then incubated at 37.degree.  C. anaerobically for 72 hours, and the colony is counted to obtain the number of cells.', 'Specifically, the Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention can be derived by culturing and modifying Bifidobacterium bifidum as a parent strain which has an effect of killing Helicobacter pylori.  As for Bifidobacterium bifidum utilizable as aparent strain, there is no particular limitation as far as it has an effect of killing Helicobacter pylori; for example, Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT 4007 (it was deposited as FERM BP-791 on Feb.  2, 1981 at International Patent Organism Depository,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken)) may be given.', 'There is no particular limitation in a method of culturing and modifying; for example, condensation method, a method of mutation by mutagen such as ultraviolet ray, nitrosoguanidine (NTG), ethylmethanesulfonic acid (EMS), and the like are given.', 'A specific example of breeding and modifying will be explained by a condensation method.  Bifidobacterium bifidum as a parent strain which has an effect of killing Helicobacter pylori is first incubated on a milk medium to give a culture broth,which is stored under aerobic condition.  Among those organism that survived, a high oxygen resistant strain is selected from the survived organisms.  More specifically, Bifidobacterium bifidum YIT4007 (FERM BP-791) is incubated on a milk medium to givea culture broth, to which is then added a syrup solution to prepare a fermented milk drink or food; and then the fermented milk drink or food is stored under aerobic condition for 21 days, and the survived organisms are selected.  Using the organismsselected as mentioned above, the same process is repeated so that the organisms having a high oxygen resistance is concentrated.  Thus, the Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention showing a survival rate of 10% or higher, preferably 10 to 40%, in thecase of being present in a fermented milk drink or food under aerobic condition at 10.degree.  C. for 14 days can be obtained.  An example of storage under aerobic condition includes storage under aeration and agitation in which atmosphere is passedthrough a storage system by continuous stirring with a stirring bar or stirring blade in aerobic state.', ""The milk culture medium used in the above condensation method refers to a culture medium containing milk as a major ingredient, wherein the milk includes cow's milk and processed product thereof, such as skim milk, and peptides derived frommilk.  There is no particular limitation in the culture condition for incubating Bifidobacterium bifidum in a milk culture medium, which may be set as appropriate in accordance with the growth condition of Bifidobacterium bifidum; in general, it isappropriate to conduct the culture anaerobically at 30-40.degree.

The killingeffect as a pharmacological action of the Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention is increased with increase of the viable cell count, and therefore, it is desirable to use Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention in a state of live organisms.  Further,since Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention has a high oxygen resistance, a large number of live cells can be sent to the stomach and intestinal tract, it can be used suitably in prevention or therapy of infection with Helicobacter pylori, inprevention or therapy of gastritis and ulcer, in prevention or therapy of indefinite complaint in stomach, or in prevention or therapy of hyperchylia and gastroesophageal reflux.', 'Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention, since it has a preventive effect for the gastric mucosa and an effect of improving the serum pepsinogen (PG) value, can be utilized in treatment or improvement or prevention of stress ulcer, necroticulcer caused by alcohol, etc., active gastritis, vestibular dominant gastritis, gastritis dominant in the body of stomach, pangastritis, gastric adenoma, hyperplastic polyp, polyp in fundic glands, atrophic gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux (refluxesophatitis), indefinite complaint in stomach (including Non-ulcer dyspepcia) and stomach cancer closely relating to infection with Helicobacter pylori.', 'In the gastric mucosa infected with Helicobacter pylori, active gastritis (cortex gastritis), which is a histological gastritis characterized by infiltration of neutrophile and a large amount of mononuclear cells, is caused.  With progress ofthe gastritis, the growth of the cells is suppressed, the cell function degrades, and the mucosa weakens, resulting in atrophic gastritis in which no active inflammatory image is observed.  With progress of the atrophic gastritis, intestinal epitherialmetaplasia is caused to increase the risk of stomach cancer.  On the other hand, tissue breakdown of the gastric mucosa which is caused by an influence of a challenge factor such as gastric acid or pepsin or drugs such as NSAIDs in a state of activegastritis results in peptic ulcer such as gastric ulcer or duodenum ulcer.  Therefore, Bifidobacterium bifidum of the invention having an effect of killing Helicobacter pylori can be utilized as a preventive or therapeutic agent for gastritis or ulcercaused by Helicobacter pylori, particularly for gastric and duodenum ulcers.

In particular embodiments of the instant invention, it may be desirable to introduce a transformation construct into a host cell in the form of a gene expression cassette.', 'As used herein, ""transformed cell"" refers to a cell in which the DNA has been altered by the introduction of one or more heterologous DNA molecules into that cell.', 'As used herein, ""transgene"" refers to a segment of DNA which has been incorporated into a host genome or is capable of autonomous replication in a host cell and is capable of causing the expression of one or more RNAs and/or polypeptides. Exemplary transgenes will provide the host cell, or plants regenerated therefrom, with a novel phenotype relative to the corresponding non-transformed cell or plant.  Transgenes may be directly introduced into a plant by genetic transformation, or may beinherited from a plant of any previous generation which was transformed with the DNA segment.', 'As used herein, ""transgenic plant"" or ""transgenic organism"" refers to a plant, progeny plant, organism, or progeny organism of any subsequent generation derived therefrom, wherein the DNA of the plant or organism or progeny thereof contains anintroduced heterologous DNA segment not naturally present at that location in a non-transgenic plant or organism of the same variety.  The transgenic plant or organism may additionally contain sequences which are native to the plant or organism beingtransformed, but wherein the gene has been altered in order to alter the level or pattern of expression of the gene, for example, by use of one or more heterologous regulatory or other elements.', 'As used herein, ""vector"" refers to a DNA molecule capable of replication in a host cell and/or to which another DNA segment can be operatively linked so as to bring about replication of the attached segment.  A plasmid is an example of a vector. A vector is a construct designed for the introduction of heterologous DNA into a host cell.  In this application, the words ""vector,"" ""plasmid,"" ""plasmid vector,"" ""transformation vector,"" and ""construct"" are used interchangeably.', 'Various embodiments of the present invention provide cloning vectors that will reduce the amount of manipulation needed to assemble gene expression cassettes into vectors.  In certain aspects of the invention, the vector contains a multiplecloning site (MCS) with sets of rare restriction and/or HE sites arranged in a linear pattern that allows the stacking of cassettes in a directional and/or recursive way; eliminating the need to design special cloning vectors for each gene expressioncassette, depending on the order and direction of this cassette in the vector stack.  This is achieved by using homing enzymes that differ in their restriction sequences, but provide compatible ends to each other upon enzyme cleavage.  For example,I-SceI and the reverse complement of PI-PspI (PI-PspI-RC) or, alternatively, PI-PspI and the reverse complement of I-SceI (I-SceI-RC) have this function.  Only one vector for each cassette is needed to allow the introduction of the cassette anywhere inthe vector stack.  This arrangement defines a modular architecture that allows the user to assemble multiple cassettes into a single vector without disturbing the integrity of DNA elements already incorporated into the vector in previous cloning steps. The underlying basis for this stacking method is that the restriction site/sites used between individual cassettes are destroyed upon recombination, but are reintroduced into the vector stack by the fragment containing the cassette to be inserted intothe stack and the vector that receives the cassette.  Therefore, further stacking is enabled without interfering with cassettes that have already been added to the stack.  When the I-SceI restriction site is used with the PI-PspI-RC restriction site tostack gene expression cassettes, SEQ ID NO:1 or 2 is located between, or adjacent these gene expression cassettes.  Further, when the reverse complement of I-SceI restriction site is used with the PI-PspI restriction site to stack gene expressioncassettes, SEQ ID NO:3 or 4 is generated and is located between or adjacent these gene expression cassettes.', 'An essential element in any cloning vector is a location for insertion of the genetic materials of interest.  This is a synthetic element that has been engineered into ""wild type"" plasmids, thus conferring utility as a cloning vector.  Anytypical commercially-available cloning vector contains at least one such region, known as a multiple cloning site (MCS).  A MCS typically comprises nucleotide sequences that may be cleaved by a single or a series of restriction enzymes, each of which hasa distinct recognition sequence and cleavage pattern.  The recognition sequences (which are also referred to as ""restriction sites"" or ""recognition sites"") in a DNA molecule often comprise a double-stranded palindromic sequence.  For some restrictionenzymes, as few as 4-6 nucleotides are sufficient to provide a recognition site, while some restriction enzymes require a sequence of 8 or more nucleotides.  The enzyme Nod, for example, recognizes the octanucleotide sequence: .sup.5\' G-C-G-G-C-C-G-C.sup.3\', where 5\' indicates the end of the molecule known by convention as the ""upstream"" end, and 3\' likewise indicates the ""downstream"" end.  The complementary strand of the recognition sequence would be its anti-parallel strand, .sup.3\'C-G-C-C-G-G-C-G .sup.5\'.  Thus, the double stranded recognition site can be represented within the larger double-stranded molecule in which it occurs as:', ""TABLE-US-00001 .sup.5' .  . .

Because A-T and G-C pairs are spontaneously formed when in proximity with each other, protruding ends such as these are called cohesive or sticky ends.  Anyone of these termini can form hydrogen bonds with any other complementary termini cleaved with the same restriction enzyme.  Since any DNA that contains a specific recognition sequence site will be cut in the same manner as any other DNA containing thesame sequence, those cleaved ends will be complementary.  Therefore, the ends of any DNA molecules cut with the same restriction enzyme ""match"" each other in the way adjacent pieces of a jigsaw puzzle ""match,"" and can be enzymatically connected (ligated)together.  It is this property that permits the formation of recombinant DNA molecules, and allows the introduction of foreign DNA fragments into bacterial plasmids, or into any other DNA molecule.  Another feature is that some restriction enzymes withdifferent recognition sites still produce the same complementary ends upon cleavage.  If DNA fragments are ligated that were cut by restriction enzymes harboring different restriction sites, but yielding complementary ends, the recombined sequence doesoften not serve as a restriction site for either restriction enzyme.', 'Some restriction enzymes cleave DNA within their recognition sequences.  Most recognize DNA sequences that are symmetric, but a few recognize asymmetric DNA sequences.  Some restriction enzymes recognize continuous sequences in which the twohalf-sites of the recognition site are adjacent, e.g., EcoRI: GAATTC.  Other restriction enzymes recognize discontinuous sequences in which the half-sites are separated, sometimes by a degenerate sequence as is the case for SfiI.', ""TABLE-US-00004 .sup.5' .  . .

The degenerate nucleotide base symbol N is according to the IUPAC nomenclature representative for a position on a DNA sequence that can have multiple possible alternatives.  N denotes anybase, not a gap in the sequence.  The degeneracy of the cleavage site can be used to design DNA sequences that are all recognized and cleaved by one restriction enzyme like SfiI, but that produce different overhangs upon cleavage, in this case 3\'overhangs.', 'A further general principle to consider when building recombinant DNA molecules is that all restriction sites occurring within a molecule will be cut with a particular restriction enzyme, not just the site of interest.  The larger a DNAmolecule, the more likely it is that any restriction site will reoccur.  Assuming that any restriction sites are distributed randomly along a DNA molecule, a tetranucleotide site will occur, on the average, once every 4.sup.4 (i.e., 256) nucleotides,whereas a hexanucleotide site will occur once every 4.sup.6 (i.e., 4096) nucleotides, and octanucleotide sites will occur once every 4.sup.8 (i.e., 114,688) nucleotides.  Thus, it can be readily appreciated that shorter recognition sequences will occurfrequently, while longer ones will occur rarely.  When planning the construction of a transgene or other recombinant DNA molecule, this is a vital issue, since such a project frequently requires the assembly of several pieces of DNA of varying sizes. The larger these pieces are, the more likely that the sites one wishes to use occur in several pieces of the DNA components, making manipulation difficult, at best.', 'Frequently occurring restriction enzymes are herein referred to as ""common restriction enzymes"" and their cognate recognition sequences are referred to as common restriction sites.  Restriction enzymes with cognate sequences greater than 6nucleotides, particularly greater than 8 nucleotides are referred to as ""rare"" restriction enzymes, and their cognate sites as rare restriction sites.', ""A second class of restriction endonuclease enzymes has recently been discovered, called homing endonuclease (HE) enzymes.  HE enzymes have large, asymmetric recognition sites (from 12-40 base pairs).  HE recognition sites are extremely rare. For example, the HE known as I-SceI has an 18 bp recognition site (5'-TAGGGATAACAGGGTAAT-3', SEQ ID NO:5), predicted to occur only once in every 7.times.10.sup.10 base pairs of random sequence.  This rate of occurrence is equivalent to only one site in20 mammalian-sized genomes.  Another HE is PI-PspI with a 30-bp recognition site (5'-TGGCAAACAGCTATTATGGGTATTATGGGT-3', SEQ ID NO:6).  Yet another HE is I-CeuI with a 29-bp long recognition site (5'-CGTAACTATAACGGTCCTAAGGTAGCGAA-3', SEQ ID NO:7).  Therare nature of HE sites greatly increases the likelihood that a genetic engineer can cut a final transgene product without disrupting the integrity of the transgene or the genome that comprises the transgene or the genome that comprises the transgene, ifHE sites were included in appropriate locations in a cloning vector."", ""In certain embodiments of the current invention, the restriction sites used to stack two cassettes into one vector are eliminated upon recombination.  If the restriction site for PI-PspI is reverse complemented(5'-ACCCATAATACCCATAATAGCTGTTTGCCA-3', SEQ ID NO:8) in the vector, the resulting overhang upon PI-PspI digestion is compatible with I-SceI (see FIG. 1).  The resulting recombined sequence is not digested by either PI-PspI or I-SceI.  Alternatively, therestriction site for I-SceI can be used in its reverse complement orientation (I-SceI-RC) to generate an overhang upon digestion with I-SceI that is compatible with the overhang generated by PI-PspI digestion of the PI-PspI restriction site.

Recall that the recognition sequences encoding any onehexanucleotide site occur every 4096 bp.  If a promoter sequence is 3000 bp and a gene of interest of 1500 bp are to be assembled into a cloning vector of 3000 bp, it is statistically very likely that many sites of six or less nucleotides will not beuseful, since any usable sites must occur in only two of the pieces.  Furthermore, the sites must occur in the appropriate areas of the appropriate molecules that are to be assembled.  In addition, most cloning projects will need to have additional DNAelements added, thereby increasing the complexity of the growing molecule and the likelihood of inopportune repetition of any particular site.  Since any restriction enzyme will cut at all of its sites in a molecule, if a restriction enzyme sitereoccurs, all the inopportune sites will be cut along with the desired sites, disrupting the integrity of the molecule.  Thus, each cloning step must be carefully planned so as not to disrupt the growing molecule by cutting it with a restriction enzymethat has already been used to incorporate a preceding element.  Since most DNA constructs are designed for a single purpose, little thought is given to any future modifications that might need to be made, further increasing the difficulty for futureexperimental changes.', 'Traditionally, transgene design and construction consumes significant amounts of time and energy for several reasons, including the following:', '1.  There is a wide variety of restriction and HE enzymes available that will generate an array of termini, however most of these are not compatible with each other.  Many restriction enzymes, such as NotI, generate DNA fragments with protruding5\' cohesive termini or ""tails""; others (e.g., SbfI) generate fragments with 3\' protruding tails, whereas still others (e.g., PmeI) cleave at the axis of symmetry to produce fragments with a blunt end.  These protruding tails from either the 5\' or 3\' endare also called 3\' or 5\' overhangs.  Other examples for overhang producing restriction enzymes are SfiI, SbfI, Mrel, SgrAI, AsiSI.  Further examples of blunt end producing restriction enzymes are SrfI and SwaI.  An additional HE enzyme is I-PpoI.  Someof these fragments with either an overhang or blunt end will be compatible with the termini formed by cleavage with other restriction and HE enzymes, but the majority of useful ones will not.  The termini that can be generated with each DNA fragmentisolation must be carefully considered in designing a DNA construct.', '2.  DNA fragments needed for assembly of a DNA construct or transgene must first be isolated from their source genomes, placed into plasmid cloning vectors, and amplified to obtain useful quantities.  The step can be performed using any numberof commercially-available or individually altered cloning vectors.  Each of the different commercially available cloning vectors were, for the most part, developed independently, and thus contain different sequences and restriction sites for the DNAfragments of genes or genetic elements of interest.  Genes must therefore be individually tailored to adapt to each of these vectors as needed for any given set of experiments.  The same DNA fragments frequently will need to be altered further forsubsequent experiments or cloning into other combinations for new DNA constructs or transgenes.  Since each DNA construct or transgene is custom made for a particular application with no thought or knowledge of how it will be used next, it frequentlymust be ""retrofitted"" for subsequent applications.', ""3.  In addition, the DNA sequence of any given gene or genetic element varies and can contain internal restriction sites that make it incompatible with currently available vectors, thereby complicating manipulation.  This is true when assemblingseveral DNA fragments into a single DNA construct, for example a promoter, gene of interest, and a terminator (3'UTR) into one gene expression cassette.  This is especially true when assembling several gene expression cassettes into one vector, called avector stack.  In most transformation approaches, a single vector containing 1-2 genes conferring desirable characteristic(s) is introduced into a host of interest via an appropriate expression vector.  Expression of a greater number of transgenes inhost cells and organisms has proven to be costly and time consuming."", 'Rather than transforming one organism multiple times with vectors harboring individual gene expression cassettes it is of advantage to perform a single transformation event that inserts all gene expression cassettes in one vector into theorganism in one step (U.S.  Patent Publ.  No. 2011/0099672).  To achieve best efficacy of the expression of multiple gene expression cassettes in such vector stacks, it is necessary to test vectors that harbor these gene expression cassettes in differentorientations and order.  FIG. 3 demonstrates the possible orientation that two gene expression cassettes can have.', 'Therefore, the modular system of the current invention, allowing one to insert gene expression cassettes in a recursive directional stacking fashion by rare restriction sites within the cloning vector is especially useful.', 'The vector systems and methods available in the prior art necessitate the use of two types of vectors to achieve this flexibility.  The first type harbors the individual gene expression cassettes with flanking regions that determine the assemblyof multiple gene expression cassettes in the second type of vector, the so-called vector stack, in the desired order and orientation.  Therefore one gene expression cassette might require the use of multiple vectors of the first type to yield the desiredvariety in the vector stacks.  And such a system might be limited by the number of usable flanking regions in the number, order, and orientation these gene expression cassettes are assembled in the vector stack.  Such flanking regions can be restrictionsites, or attenuation sites for homologous recombination events.', 'Thus, the various embodiments of the instant invention that allow the user to rapidly assemble gene expression cassettes in any order, orientation, and number, into one vector, without the prerequisite to prepare the individual gene expressioncassettes for the desired order in vectors first, are advantageous.', 'Transgene Expression Constructs', 'In various embodiments of the invention, transgene coding sequences operably linked to a promoter (e.g., a heterologous promoter) are provided, in either sense or antisense orientation.

These DNA segments can further include structures such aspromoters, enhancers, polylinkers, regulatory genes, and/or any other sequence, as desired.  The DNA segment or gene chosen for cellular introduction may encode a protein which will be expressed in the resultant recombinant cells, resulting in ascreenable or selectable trait and/or which will impart an improved phenotype to the resulting transgenic plant.

Tissue-specific promoterssuch as root cell promoters (Conkling et al., 1990) and tissue-specific enhancers (Fromm et al., 1986) may also be useful, as are inducible promoters such as ABA- and turgor-inducible promoters.

By facilitating thetransport of the protein into compartments inside and outside the cell, these sequences may increase the accumulation of gene product protecting them from proteolytic degradation.  These sequences also allow for additional mRNA sequences from highlyexpressed genes to be attached to the coding sequence of the genes.  Since mRNA being translated by ribosomes is more stable than naked mRNA, the presence of translatable mRNA in front of the gene may increase the overall stability of the mRNA transcriptfrom the gene and thereby increase synthesis of the gene product.  Since transit and signal sequences are usually post-translationally removed from the initial translation product, the use of these sequences allows for the addition of extra translatedsequences that may not appear on the final polypeptide.  It further is contemplated that targeting of certain proteins may be desirable in order to enhance the stability of the protein (U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,545,818, incorporated herein by reference in itsentirety).', 'Additionally, vectors may be constructed and employed in the intracellular targeting of a specific gene product within the cells of a transgenic plant or in directing a protein to the extracellular environment.  This generally will be achievedby joining a DNA sequence encoding a transit or signal peptide sequence to the coding sequence of a particular gene.  The resultant transit, or signal, peptide will transport the protein to a particular intracellular, or extracellular destination,respectively, and will then be post-translationally removed.', 'Marker Genes', 'By employing a selectable or screenable marker protein, one can provide or enhance the ability to identify transformants.  ""Marker genes"" are genes that impart a distinct phenotype to cells expressing the marker protein and often provide a meansto more efficiently distinguish such transformed cells from cells that do not have the marker.  Such genes may encode either a selectable or screenable marker, depending on whether the marker confers a trait which one can ""select"" for by chemical means,i.e., through the use of a selective agent (e.g., a herbicide, antibiotic, or the like), or whether it is simply a trait that one can identify through observation or testing, i.e., by ""screening"" (e.g., the green fluorescent protein).

Secretable proteins fall into a number of classes, including small, diffusible proteins detectable, e.g.,by ELISA; small active enzymes detectable in extracellular solution (e.g., .alpha.-amylase, .beta.-lactamase, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase); and proteins that are inserted or trapped in the cell wall (e.g., proteins that include a leader sequencesuch as that found in the expression unit of extensin or tobacco PR-S).', 'Many selectable marker coding regions are known and could be used with the present invention including, but not limited to, neo (Potrykus et al., 1985), which provides kanamycin resistance and can be selected for using kanamycin, G418,paromomycin, etc.; bar, which confers bialaphos or phosphinothricin resistance; a mutant EPSP synthase protein (Hinchee et al., 1988) conferring glyphosate resistance; a nitrilase such as bxn from Klebsiella ozaenae which confers resistance to bromoxynil(Stalker et al., 1988); a mutant acetolactate synthase (ALS) which confers resistance to imidazolinone, sulfonylurea, or other ALS inhibiting chemicals (European Patent Application 154,204, 1985); a methotrexate resistant DHFR (Thillet et al., 1988), adalapon dehalogenase that confers resistance to the herbicide dalapon; or a mutated anthranilate synthase that confers resistance to 5-methyl tryptophan.', 'Screenable markers that may be employed include a .beta.-glucuronidase (GUS) or uidA gene which encodes an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates are known; an R-locus gene, which encodes a product that regulates the production ofanthocyanin pigments (red color) in plant tissues (Dellaporta et al., 1988); a .beta.-lactamase gene (Sutcliffe, 1978), which encodes an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates are known (e.g., PADAC, a chromogenic cephalosporin); a xylE gene(Zukowsky et al., 1983) which encodes a catechol dioxygenase that can convert chromogenic catechols; an .alpha.-amylase gene (Ikuta et al., 1990); a tyrosinase gene (Katz et al., 1983) which encodes an enzyme capable of oxidizing tyrosine to DOPA anddopaquinone which in turn condenses to form the easily-detectable compound melanin; a .beta.-galactosidase gene, which encodes an enzyme for which there are chromogenic substrates; a luciferase (lux) gene (Ow et al., 1986), which allows forbioluminescence detection; an aequorin gene (Prasher et al., 1985) which may be employed in calcium-sensitive bioluminescence detection; or a gene encoding for green fluorescent protein (Sheen et al., 1995; Haseloff et al., 1997; Reichel et al., 1996;Tian et al., 1997; WO 97/41228).', 'Example Transgenes', 'Male Sterility', 'Examples of genes conferring male sterility include those disclosed in U.S.  Pat.

Cassettes could be added to an existing vector or vector stack eitherdownstream (3'-terminal) or upstream (5'-terminal) of the cassette or cassettes already present in the vector stack.  The process of adding cassettes to the stack down- or upstream could be repeated in unlimited fashion in theory and is limited inpractice by the size of the vector that can still be successfully used for transformation.  The principle is the following: One restriction site is used to cut both the vector to isolate the DNA fragment that contains the cassette to be added, and thevector that will accept this cassette.  This restriction site is retained upon recombination to generate the vector stack and thus is available for putative subsequent stacking.  The second restriction site used is different for the isolation of the DNAfragment containing the cassette (site 2a, I-SceI site in FIG. 7) and the vector that the cassette is inserted into (site 2b, PI-PspI-RC site in FIG. 7).  The two different restriction enzymes, now called restriction enzyme 2a and restriction enzyme 2bfor exemplary purposes, still generate compatible ends and, upon assembly of the vector stack, this recombined site is not recognized by either restriction enzyme 2a or restriction enzyme 2b.  However, due to the design of the vector, restriction sites2a and 2b are still present in the vector stack, since restriction site 2a is still present in the vector used for stacking (highlighted in a star), and restriction site 2b gets reintroduced into the vector stack by the DNA fragment that contains thecassette to be added (highlighted in a star).  This method is shown in more detail in FIG. 7.

Upon integration of the cassette 2-containing fragment into the linearized vector containing cassette 1, theI-CeuI recognition site was retained, but the PI-PspI-RC site of the vector with cassette 1 and the I-SceI site of the vector with cassette 2 were lost.  However, since the vector with cassette 1 still contained a I-SceI recognition site (highlightedwith a star box in FIG. 7), and the vector with cassette 2 still contained a recognition site for PI-PspI-RC (also highlighted with a star box in FIG. 7), both recognition sites for I-SceI and PI-PspI-RC were still present in the double-stack vector withcassette 1 and cassette 2 and all three recognition sites (I-CeuI, I-SceI and PI-PspI-RC) could be used for adding more cassettes according to the same principle.  Only restriction and HE sites that were unique in the vector and available for additionalstacking steps are shown in FIG. 7.', 'The order of cassettes 1 and 2 in the double-stack vector could be reversed by isolating cassette 1 and inserting it into the linearized vector with cassette 2.', 'Example 3', 'Construction of Two Double-gene Stack Vectors', 'Instead of using an all homing enzyme approach (I-CeuI, PI-PspI, I-SceI) as shown in Example 2 and FIG. 7, a blunt-end cutter (SwaI or SrfI) can be used for adding another cassette downstream or upstream of a cassette already contained in avector.  FIG. 8 demonstrates the construction of two double-stack vectors.  Double 2 is a vector containing cassette 1 and cassette 2 and is generated by linearizing the vector containing cassette 1 with I-SceI and SwaI and inserting a fragmentcontaining cassette 2 that is produced by isolation with SwaI and PI-PspI digestion.  Since sites for SwaI, I-SceI, and PI-PspI-RC are still present in the assembled two-cassette stack vector, additional cassettes can be added.  Double 3 is a vectorcontaining cassette 4 and cassette 3 and is generated by linearizing the vector containing cassette 3 with SrfI and PI-PspI and inserting a fragment containing cassette 4 that is produced by isolation with SrfI and I-SceI digestion.  Again, Double 3contains SrfI, PI-PspI-RC, and I-SceI restriction sites and can be used for additional cassette stacking.  In both examples for Double 2 and Double 3, the restriction site between the two cassettes is destroyed, since recombination sequences of I-SceIand PI-PspI-RC are not recognized by enzymes used in this invention, but these sites are reintroduced into the double-stack vector by the respective recognition sites of the linearized vector, as well as the cassettes containing isolated fragment(highlighted by a star box in FIG. 8).

The vector with cassette 5 is linearized with SrfI and AscI, and cassette 6 is isolated by digestion with AscI and PmeI.  Recombination of linearized vector and isolated cassette leadsto a head-to-head orientation of cassette 6 to cassette 5.  The resulting double-stack can be further used for additional stacking as shown in FIG. 10 by adding cassette 7 downstream to cassette 5 using I-SceI and SwaI to linearize the double-stackvector and PI-PspI and SwaI to isolate the DNA fragment containing cassette 7.  Additional stacking downstream of cassette 7 is possible.  In addition, the entire three-cassette stack could be isolated by digestion with I-CeuI and I-SceI and could beused for insertion into another vector of this invention.  However, the AscI site of the above described two- and three-cassette vector stacks is now located between two cassettes (cas 6 and cas 5, as well as cas 5 and cas 7), and the PmeI site is nowlocated upstream and downstream of cassette 7.  Both AscI and PmeI are unavailable for further stacking purposes, since the both sites now appear more than once in the vector and are thus no longer unique.', 'It is contemplated in this invention that cassettes might be assembled in reverse orientation in the vector, thus achieving head-to-head or tail-to-head orientation without the loss of restriction sites for further stacking purposes (FIG. 11).', 'Example 6', 'Construction of a Three-cassette Vector Stack in Tail-to-tail and Head-to-head Orientation', 'By utilizing another overhang-generating restriction enzyme, SbfI, a cassette can be added in reverse orientation downstream of another cassette (FIG. 12).

Cassette 10 is isolated by PI-PspI and SwaI digestion and inserted into the linearized double-stack vector in head-to-head orientation to cassette 9 (See FIG. 12). Alternatively, the triple-stack vector can be generated by inserting an isolated cassette 10 fragment into a linearized vector containing cassette 8 and linearizing the resulting double-stack vector and inserting an isolated cassette 9.

Field of Invention', 'The invention relates to methods, systems and apparatus for safe, efficient, environmentally responsible extraction and utilization of Lake Kivu deepwater resources, particularly deployed for power generation from biogas directly combined with""green"" industrial utilization of massive associated CO.sub.2 to secure local safety, generate employment, accelerate regional economic growth, build a global R&D network hub for Rwanda, and create a globally significant demonstration of the businessviability of very large scale CO.sub.2 ""Carbon Capture and Utilization"" (CCU).', '2.  Description of Related Art', ""A major challenge of the contemporary age is to halt the continuing increase in the CO.sub.2 concentration of the Earth's atmosphere.  Important related agendas are to develop new large-scale ways to utilize CO.sub.2 commercially with economicviability.  For example, it is desirable to recycle CO.sub.2 rather than to continue to utilize drilled flows of subterranean CO.sub.2 for use in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations.  These flows amount to roughly 60 millions of tonnes CO.sub.2 peryear in the US (Wallace and Kuuskraa, 2014).  Mostly they are obtained from drilling wells that tap high-purity CO.sub.2 reserves present in large trapped geo-pressurized accumulations analogous to those of natural gas (methane, NG, CH.sub.4)."", 'The huge amount of dissolved CO.sub.2 (.about.600 million tonnes) trapped at depth in Lake Kivu stands in a different category.  It presents a mortal threat in the region as well as to the ecosystem of Lake Kivu.  It is only temporarily trappedin the deep lake.  It will be released to the atmosphere by a catastrophic natural process of runaway convective release within a century or two unless preventative action is taken to degas a substantial fraction of the reserve.', ""Two options have been considered and debated between scientific experts, engineers and governmental leaders engaged in planning for large-scale utilization of Lake Kivu's deepwater biomethane resource.  Like the CO.sub.2, this resource ispresent as dissolved gas.  It amounts to .about.50 million tonnes of CH.sub.4.  The two options are: (i) an environmentally unattractive option to degas Lake Kivu's CO.sub.2 and, in parallel with utilization of its biomethane, to vent the degassedCO.sub.2 to the atmosphere, or (ii) return extracted CO.sub.2 to the depths of the lake employing a simple process broadly within the design space of the type of extraction system first developed by Belgian engineers in the 1950s (for the first methanefueled powerplant developed on Lake Kivu in .about.1960).  The second option extends the risk faced by the local population of a possible mass catastrophe.  In its maximal extent, such a catastrophe has the potential to asphyxiate more than two millionpeople.  Therefore, neither choice is attractive."", 'Related art is described in three categories.  The first is directly related art.  This comprises two pending patent applications by the inventor focused on solving specific problems of Lake Kivu deepwater resources utilization.  US 2015/0354451A1 relates to a method for safe, efficient, economically productive, environmentally responsible, extraction and utilization of dissolved gases in deep waters of a lake susceptible to limnic eruptions in which methane is accompanied by abundant carbondioxide.  This method applies a technology known as oxyfuel combustion in combination with an innovative modality of degassing of Lake Kivu deepwater gas.  Oxyfuel combustion has been developed as a way to develop drilled acid- and sour-gas reserves,yielding power and a stream of exhaust comprised of water vapor plus nominally pure CO.sub.2.  The inventor\'s disclosure in US 2015/0354451 A1 shows how Lake Kivu deepwater gas can be developed by an innovative modified method that obtains gas dissolvedin deepwater by extraction within an upward flow of water, degasses it, and then produces three outputs.  These are: (i) power; (ii) an exhaust of water vapor plus nominally pure CO.sub.2; and (iii) a stream of degassed nutrient-rich deepwater utilizablein various valuable ways.  U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1 relates to a method for treating nutrient-rich dense deepwater from Lake Kivu.  Also of broadly-related interest is the patent of Evgeny Yantovsky, 2002.  U.S.  Pat.  No.6,477,841, ""Closed Cycle Power Plant"" which concerns the connection of a lake to a zero emissions power plant (Yantovsky and McGovern, 2006; Yantovsky, 2008, 2009; Yantovsky et al., 2009, chapter 8).', 'The second category of related art is industrial CO.sub.2 production from drilled sources.  Lake Kivu is not a drilled source.  The extraction of CO.sub.2 from Lake Kivu deepwater is based on pipe extraction within an open body of water. CO.sub.2 flows upwards in pipes or risers in a dissolved state in water.  A brief description is provided in following describing the development of industrial CO.sub.2 capture from drilled artesian well sources in the late 19.sup.th century.  Thesesources combine drilling-based access to the resource with CO.sub.2 flowing upwards in water in a dissolved state.  Brief mention also is made of the development of very large CO.sub.2 drilled gas well reservoirs exploited mostly in the Western USA. These are gas wells.  Carbon dioxide rises upwards in the wells without being dissolved in water.  Such discussions provide pertinent background covering the extraction of CO.sub.2 by methods and systems using drilling to access the resource.', 'The third category is contextually related art.  This type of related art covers a wide range of aspects of CO.sub.2 utilization for industrial purposes such as variously are, or may be, contained within embodiments of the invention, involvingcarbon dioxide utilization.  Related art involving CO.sub.2 utilization is presented at extended length herein.  Doing so is appropriate for describing related art in order to promote clear understanding of three aspects of pertinent knowledge.  Theseare: (i) the nested set of quite different problems the invention has been created to solve; (ii) the nature of a core aspect of the invention which is open to, and seeks, incorporation of many highly diverse technologies for CO.sub.2 utilization, andrelated ""greentech"" industrial production activities; and (iii) a wide and diverse background to the inventive art involved, knowledge of which provides a teaching to facilitate practice of the invention.', 'Carbon dioxide has never been sourced for industrial utilization from a dissolved source present in a lake.  Lake sources of concentrated dissolved CO.sub.2 that potentially are utilizable as CO.sub.2 sources in large flows (greater than 100,000tonnes per year) over extended periods of time are unknown in the world, with one exception only: that being the focus of the present disclosure.  Also, whereas methane has been obtained and utilized from a dissolved source in a lake (Lake Kivu), carbondioxide has never been sourced from a lake in a manner wherein associated dissolved methane also is co-extracted and utilized within an efficiently coordinated process such that neither CO.sub.2 nor methane is wasted.  In general, CO.sub.2-dominatedhyper-""acid"" natural gas occurrences of the type present in Lake Kivu\'s deepwater are widely considered to be unattractive to develop.  For example, Indonesia\'s CO.sub.2-rich (.about.71% mole fraction CO.sub.2) offshore ""East Natuna"" giant field has beenknown since 1970, but has been left undeveloped (Wikipedia: East Natuna Gas Field; Batubara et al., 2014.  Estimated recoverable methane: .about.46 Trillion Cubic Feet, TCF).', 'Neither Government overseeing the development of Lake Kivu\'s deepwater resources has expressed potential utility for the CO.sub.2 present in the lake (e.g., Expert Working Group on Lake Kivu Extraction, 2009, 2010; Ndimubanzi, 2014).  Carbondioxide is not considered to be a resource in the common document called ""Management Prescriptions for the Development of Lake Kivu Resources,"" (Expert Working Group on Lake Kivu Extraction, 2009, 2010).  Lake Kivu\'s CO.sub.2 has been considered to be athreat, an environmental nuisance, and an obstacle to be overcome for obtaining power efficiently from the dissolved methane that is present.', ""In East Africa, CO.sub.2 is supplied for industrial use, especially beverage carbonation (including beer), by the Kenyan company Carbacid (CO.sub.2) Limited (http://www.carbacid.co.ke).  Carbacid obtains its CO.sub.2 from a Kereita Forest springsource.  This source has been developed by drilling to create an artesian well that exsolves CO.sub.2 upon depressurization as the flow approaches the surface.  Uncapped, it provides a fountaining jet of water and CO.sub.2.  (See photo of the initialfountain jet in: http://www.carbacid.co.ke/about/).  Carbon dioxide is upwelling in the crust in the region as a consequence of rift tectonics and associated active volcanism (cf, Lee et al., 2016).  Carbacid's source of CO.sub.2 is identical in designwith that of the world's first large-scale industrial CO.sub.2 capture plant developed in Herste Germany in the late 19.sup.th century in an area of mineral springs near Paderborn, (Muller, undated).  The Herste source was drilled and developed forCO.sub.2 capture in 1894-5 by Carl Gustav Rommenholler, founder of Kohlensaurewerke C. G. Rommenholler GmbH (Schwedt, 2015: Quinn and Jones, 1936).  Rommenholler patented his artesian well CO.sub.2 extraction and capture method with E. Leehrmann in 1887(Almqvist, 2003; Wender, 1901)"", 'Both Carbacid\'s and Rommenholler\'s sources of CO.sub.2 are equivalent in design to those drilled by the founders of the German sparkling mineral water company Gerolsteiner, operating since 1888 (www.gerolsteinder.de) in the German town ofGerolstein.  Gerolsteiner extracts the mineral water, and the CO.sub.2 it uses to re-carbonate it, from a drilled artesian well fountaining water and CO.sub.2.  Initially, Gerolsteiner\'s first source in 1888 fountained a jet of water and CO.sub.2 to aheight of over 50 meters.  (See photos in: https://www.gerolsteiner.de/de/gerolsteiner-brunnen/historie/; http://www.eat-drink-etc.com/showcase/Gerolsteiner; Gerolsteiner, 2013, 2015).  Gerolsteiner\'s present day sources are similar to the nearbyCO.sub.2-exsolving ""cold geysers"" drilled in the region in the village of Wallenborn bei Gerolstein (Menhert, 2016), and also in Andernach in the Geopark Vulkanland Eifel nearby (Wikipedia: Andernach Geser).  Several such drilled cold geysers exist inthe USA (Kaushik, 2015).  (Glennon et al., 2004 provides a worldwide inventory of both natural and man-made cold geysers).  Carbon dioxide in the volcanic Eifel region of Germany bubbles up in large amounts from the bottom of a volcanic crater lake, theLaacher See, but is not captured for use (Goepel et al., 2014).  Artificially created cold geysers historically associated with carbonated mineral water bottling and German-style CO.sub.2 capture operations include those in Saratoga Springs N.Y.  (Quinnand Jones, 1936; Millet, 2015; Sarasota Springs Heritage Area Visitor Center, 2009; Stoddard, 1895).  Carbon dioxide is captured for the carbonation of many well-known mineral waters by methods identical to that practiced by Carbacid and Gerolsteiner. It is separated from the depressurization flows of artesian wells and redissolved under pressure into mineral waters during the bottling process.  Prominent examples of bottled sparkling mineral waters obtained by this method include: Appolinaris andSelters (Germany), Perrier and Badoit (France), San Pelligrino and Ferrarelle (Italy), Walsdquelle (Austria), and Borsec (Romania), (LaMoreaux and Tanner, 2002).', ""Well sources used for bottling mineral waters with CO.sub.2 capture from upflow degassing are non-polluting.  They typically do not contain dissolved substances that cause eutrophication when released into surface water river flows.  The designof extraction systems therefore does not involve engineering to avoid surface water pollution.  Such sources also are selected for a high purity of CO.sub.2 emission thereby avoiding the need to refine the gas to remove contaminating gases such asmethane, nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide.  Separating minor (<30% molar) amounts of methane from major amounts of CO.sub.2 is a capital- and energy-intensive process (e.g., ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze Zone.TM.  CFZ.TM., process.

The nation has made impressive strides forward buildinga lawful order with expanding peace and prosperity in the interval since it experienced a catastrophic genocidal disaster in 1994.  Rwanda\'s Parliament and executive leadership have created a set of well-defined national goals in ""Rwanda 2020"" andassociated ""EDPRS2"" documents (see: ""Government of Rwanda"" in references).  Reaching these goals requires a new phase of rapid industrialization.  Rapid industrialization is necessary to create new modalities of economic livelihood with increasedproductivity for the large fraction of Rwanda\'s citizens living mostly by traditional agriculture.  At present, more than 80% of Rwanda\'s total population of .about.11 million people live in rural situations.  Their main economic activity is traditionalforms of agriculture and husbandry (plantain/banana, corn/maize, cassava, soy and green beans, millet, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, sorghum, carrots, tomatoes, sugar cane, coffee, tea, goats, sheep, chickens, pigs, dairy and beef cattle, etc.).  Mostlive predominantly without access to electricity or to self-owned motorized equipment.  Industrialization in Rwanda appropriately will involve several million people diversifying their activity into new types of jobs utilizing modern technologies.', 'According to the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, Carlos Lopes, optimally advantageous industrialization in Rwanda and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) should include three characteristics.  They are: (i)substantial value addition to natural resources prior to export; (ii) industrialization leapfrogging to utilize new clean ""greentech"" technologies; and (iii) expansion of trade between the nations within Sub-Saharan Africa\'s rapidly growing markets(Lopes, 2015b).', ""Rural electrification with a low cost of power is a clear and obvious agenda.  Low cost power is necessary to accelerate economic growth.  Low-cost engine fuels also are necessary for rapid industrialization.  Low cost electricity and low-costengine fuels together provide a critical foundation for industrialization to build upon.  However, Rwanda is in a situation of high cost electricity (>US$0.20/kWh) and high cost engine fuels (>US$1.2/liter).  This situation is preventingrealization of the country's economic goals."", ""Rwanda possesses an unusual and abundant energy resource: 50% of a large reserve of natural biogas (methane: CH.sub.4), .about.50 million tonnes (MT).  This biogas is dissolved in the depths of a large lake, Lake Kivu.  Lake Kivu is sharedgeographically .about.50:50 between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  The gas exists together in Lake Kivu's deepwater with an extremely high amount of associated carbon dioxide, .about.600 MT.

It is geothermally injected into the deep lake.  A large upward flux of CO.sub.2 is associated with the active volcanic province adjacent to the lake\'s northernboundary and situated within the structure of the Albertine rift.  Lake Kivu\'s deepwater acts as a trap for this ascending CO.sub.2.  Gases build-up over time.  They are released catastrophically in irregularly periodic convective runaway events called""limnic eruptions."" Artificial extraction of deepwater CO.sub.2 changes the dynamics from all-at-once events to a steady rate of removal over time.  However, artificial CO.sub.2 extraction does not increase the overall CO.sub.2 emission rate averagedover a timescale of hundreds of years.  The overall CO.sub.2 flux from the crust into the atmosphere in the region is set by underlying natural processes of tectono-magmatic transport.  These transport processes make the northern Lake Kivu sector one ofthe largest natural emission sources of CO.sub.2 in the world.  (For the same reason, geothermal energy producing nations avoid accounting for CO.sub.2 emissions associated with geothermal energy.  See: Arnannsson, 2003, 2005.)

The invention utilizes feeding of both gases, unseparated, into an oxyfuel combustor supplied with oxygen gas via anAir Separation Unit (ASU).  It also organizes return flow of the deepwater into the lake in a fully degassed state.  One aspect of the output of this power production method is that it generates a post-combustion exhaust comprised of a mixture ofcondensable steam plus nearly pure CO.sub.2.', ""In U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1, the inventor further disclosed a method and system for total degassing with treatment of the return flow of degassed water in such a way to decrease its density by creating abundantphotosynthetic bioproducts and precipitated magnesium hydroxide [brucite: Mg(OH).sub.2].  This allows replacement of degassed and de-densified water just below the base of the lake's biozone, thereby optimizing long-term lake safety, capturing a verylarge component of valuable methane otherwise lost, and creating useful products in the de-densification process.  Production of precipitated brucite then allows large scale production of eco-concrete and related building materials by utilizing CO.sub.2and steam to carbonate and hydrate Mg-cement and Mg-cement-pozzolan compositions.  The bioprocessing of return flow water additionally produces very large quantities of algal biomass and associated products.  Overall, the method offers .about..times.2.5factor increase in electricity production per unit of methane present in Lake Kivu, relative to standard technologies.  The method also adds a large factor multiplier to overall industrial productivity by production of bioproducts and eco-concretes andrelated building materials with value greatly exceeding that of electricity.  In this method, however, deepwater bicarbonate ion provides the main carbon source for photosynthetic bioproduction, rather than CO.sub.2."", 'None of these disclosures have addressed how optimally to utilize the full scale of the massive quantities of deepwater CO.sub.2 released by a ""total degassing"" process.

Many technologies exist matched with attractive market opportunities in the region and beyond.  Meeting such a challenge in the situation of Lake Kivu in the center of Africais non-trivial.  It requires inventive new technology in several different types combined together.', 'Industrializing systems of innovative machines are necessary to a long-term better economic future for hundreds of millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  Long-term economic development is a consequence of ""market creating""industrialization: the creation of systems of innovative machines managed with the capability to allow people to transform basic resources into valuable and exportable products efficiently, on a large scale, with market competitiveness, thereby creatingnew high-value trade, high-value employment and widespread prosperity (Economic Commission for Africa, 2014, 2015; Lopes, 2015a,b; Arkhangelskaya and Taylor, 2014; Taylor, 2014a,b; African Transformation Report, 2014; Christensen, 2014; Mezue et al.,2015).  Industrialization based on industrial technology transfer creating a basis for production and export trade has long been the core driver of spectacular economic growth in rapidly developing countries over the past 50 years.  The dynamic ofsuccessful 20.sup.th century industrialization has operated through various modes of change including entrepreneurship, new scientific and engineering insights, capital investment, government policies and wartime emergencies (Maddison, 2001, 2005, 2007,2008).  Underneath all of these aspects of understanding, it can be useful to recognize that growth in employment and prosperity fundamentally is built upon mechanical productivity: that is machines.  Innovative systems of machines drive enhancements inhuman productivity.  (Typically these are factories.  However, systems of machines also include IT-based coordinated productivity.) Machines provide the basic nexus for the multiplication of output per person of goods and services.  Machines are the sinequa non, the without-which-nothing, whereby human activity is multiplied drastically in economic productivity, thereby advancing prosperity (Lewis, 2004).', 'The creation of systems of industrial machines to produce low-cost power is a doubly foundational aspect of industrialization.  Electricity is one of the basic forms of industrial power.  Yet roughly 600 million citizens in SSA are disconnectedfrom access to electricity needed to power machines necessary to leverage economic productivity.', 'The Manufacturing Value Added (MVA) percentage of GDP is an index for accessing national performance in industrial productivity (UNIDO, undated).  MVA has fallen drastically in SSA over the past 40 years: from .about.18% to .about.10%, whilesimultaneously MVA has expanded massively in East Asia (Rowden, 2013).  Per capita manufacturing value addition in Rwanda, a country with massive gains in governance and growth but still mainly exporting commodity dried coffee beans, tea leaves and rawminerals, was .about.$30 per person per year in 2014 (with MVA at 6% of GDP).  This may be compared to .about.$1,900 for China, .about.$6,000 for the USA and .about.$10,000 for Singapore (UNIDO, 2015; GlobalEconomy.com, undated).  Such statisticsindicate a massive industrialization gap consistent with Rwanda scoring as one of the world\'s least industrialized societies in UNIDO reports (UNIDO, 2013, 2015).  An estimated 83% of Rwandans inhabit rural regions where they live mostly by farmingactivity (NISR, 2014; de la Victoire, 2014), working with their hands using baskets and hoes as their major form of technology leverage.  Rwanda has outstanding potential from its many reforms, thriving capital city and rapidly rising per capita GDP. Its low industrialization represents one of the greatest opportunities in the world for rapid human betterment.  Rwandan leaders are aware of this challenge and opportunity.  They have established a policy to encourage very rapid growth in the industrialeconomy (Economic Commission for Africa, 2015b; Ministry of Trade and Industry, 2011).  Turning policies into realities, however, will require installing systems of industrial machines on a large scale through private enterprise and governmental jointventures with the private sector.  Future growth depends especially on ""moving up the value chain"" (Kaberuka, 2015) by both processing traditional products such as coffee, tea and minerals to add value, and by creating completely new modes of productionfor export.  Overall, sustained development of Rwanda and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa depends on success in accelerating industrialization in energy, manufacturing and technologically modernized agriculture (Economic Commission for Africa,2015a; African Transformation Report, 2014).', 'Systems of industrial machines require both policy support and intrinsic profitability to grow rapidly through initial capital investment with follow-on investment pursuing demonstrated success.  Areas of particular promise will demonstrateindustrial clustering potential from the presence of abundant low-cost resources and associated opportunities to transform these resources into locally useful and/or exportable products possessing substantial value-addition.  Successful clusterdevelopment, however, additionally requires attracting many highly innovative technically trained people (Porter, 1998; Wadhwa, 201).  That sometimes is not easy in Africa, though Rwanda benefits from a very impressive returning diaspora.  While resourceextraction productivity can operate in isolation, as in the case of offshore oil platforms, and whereas broadband Internet communications now can create global virtual video-community networks easily, the development of clustering sufficient forindustrial-economic take-off, and the rapid growth of knowledge capital more generally (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2015, 2016), still requires the ability to attract many high-talent people to a region.', 'Lake Kivu is one of the most elegantly beautiful and climatologically attractive regions in the world.  Though relatively little known, its future holds tremendous potential (Kivu Belt, 2013).', 'Systems of industrial machines are a key to greentech transformation to achieve ""green economy"" environmental goals (UNEP, 2014, 2015).  The increase of carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) in the atmosphere from industrial activity is widely considered tohave generated a substantial global risk from the possibility of major climatic system instabilities (IPCC, 2015).  Accordingly, one of the challenges of the age is to find solutions to address this risk.  Talented people all over the world are focusedon this task.  Attractive solutions especially will avoid constraining economic growth, in particular growth that benefits emerging market economies where the need for development is great, as in Sub-Saharan Africa.  One agenda being widely pursued is todevelop ways to create power, fuels and industrial products in ways that absorb, utilize and recycle, rather than emit, CO.sub.2, and that do so with superior performance in the competitive economic marketplace.  Despite intense research and manyimpressive scientific-technological breakthroughs, only limited substantially scaled examples exist in industry.  The largest quantities of utilized CO.sub.2 are injected into oil wells via CO.sub.2-based Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO.sub.2-EOR, Meyer, 2007:Al-Mjeni et al., 2010/2011; Muggeridge et al., 2015).  Most of this CO.sub.2, however, is not recycled.

This coalition is seeking to decrease the flux of CO.sub.2 released by human activities into the atmosphere.  However, the rapidindustrial development of developing countries, a vital matter for the alleviation of mass poverty, drives accelerating growth in world CO.sub.2 output.  Hence a conundrum exists.  Strategies that encourage the persistence of mass poverty are unlikely tosucceed.  Therefore a key challenge is to transform new industrialization, especially in developing countries, from standard high-CO.sub.2 modes to ""greentech"" modes.

To be useful for environmentalpurposes, industrial CO.sub.2 utilization requires the development of profitable uses for CO.sub.2 in large quantities, especially involving, wherever possible, carbon recycling as well as inputs of renewable sources of power (Olah et al., 2011).  Scalematters.  To make a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon accumulation, overall CO.sub.2 utilization targets worldwide should sum to at least, say, 10% of the human CO.sub.2 emissions rate of .about.35 billion tonnes (35.times.10.sup.9 T) per year(=.about.10 billion tonnes elemental carbon per year).  The agenda and challenge is to inaugurate a new mode of dynamic industrialization wherein new modes of CO.sub.2 utilization contribute substantially to economic growth.  This requires new forms ofindustrial production at a total CO.sub.2 utilization scale of several billion tonnes per year.  This challenge therefore unavoidably must be focused predominantly on products in areas of very large-scale production in terms of mass.  Such arenas includeagriculture and wood production, mining and metallurgy, fuels extraction and production, plastics manufacture, and the production of cement-based building materials and aggregate such as provide the inputs into the production of concrete.  Concrete(cement+aggregate+water), for example, is produced on a global scale of roughly 30 billion tonnes per annum (Smil, 2013; Armstrong, 2013).  For comparison, world liquid transport fuels production is about 5 BTA, (USEIA, 2015; BP, 2015), world iron oreproduction is about 3 BTA (USGS, 2015), world roundwood production is about 1.5 BTA (FAO, 2014), world plastics production is about 0.3 BTA (Gourmelon, 2015) and world aluminum ore bauxite production and processing is about 0.25 MTA (USGS, 2015). Examples of industrial CO.sub.2 utilization linking with these large scale forms of production include: (i) structural capture into cements and concretes; (ii) sequestering CO.sub.2 underground via processes of enhanced oil recovery, EOR (NETL/DOE,2010), (iii) utilizing CO.sub.2 as a carbon source for energy storage in transportation fuels by CO.sub.2 reduction with hydrogen obtained from renewable sources by water electrolysis; (iv) creating CO.sub.2-sourced replacement for petrochemicals inplastics manufacture such as for example polyethylene and polyurethane; (v) increasing agricultural productivity both by CO.sub.2 plant feeding and high-yield sustainable forest management; and (vi) developing low-cost mining and ore processingtechnologies extracting major industrial metals such as iron and/or nickel and/or aluminum using processes that mineralize carbon.', ""A major challenge moving forward is to create economically viable examples of conglomerated CO.sub.2 utilization industrial networks.  In such networks, waste CO.sub.2 would create a basis for industrialization across a range of specific modesof CO.sub.2 utilization.  This task has not been achieved.  No examples exist.  The world's largest mode of industrial CO.sub.2 utilization, CO.sub.2-EOR, is dominated by CO.sub.2 pipeline networks in the United States (NETL/DOE, 2010; Department ofEnergy, 2015).

Below .about.100 meters, trapped gases are present in a stack of anoxic layers known collectively as the ""monimolimnion."" In these, the water density increases in a stepwise manner down to a maximum depth of 485 meters.  Lake Kivu\'s main methane reserveis below 250 meters.  It contains a total amount of dissolved methane (CH.sub.4) of about 32 million tons (approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet, TCF).  Dissolved CO.sub.2 also is present: about 423 million tons (Capart and Kuffrath, 1956; Schmitz andKuffrath, 1955; Tietze, 1978, 1980a,b; 2000, 2007 Wuest et al., 2009, 2012; Tassi et al. 2009).

Thedanger is from the possibility of very large scale convective runaway gas release ""limnic eruption"" (Sigurdsson et al., 1987; Kling et al., (1987); Tietze, (1992); Zhang, (1996); Halbwachs et al., (2004); Schmid et al., (2004, 2005); Zhang and Kling,(2006); Halbwachs, (2014); and Vaselli et al.

A future event in Lake Kivu likely would be triggered by lake bottom volcanism in the northern sector of the lake.  Bathymetric surveys have revealed the presence of several volcanogenic cones onthe deep lake bottom.  The natural quasi-periodicity of convective runaway events is approximately every 1,000 years.  The last event occurred .about.900 years ago.  This is known from studies of sediment cores from Lake Kivu which reveal evidence ofpast convective runaway events in the lake.  All appear to have been triggered by volcanic activity according to the evidence found in these cores (Haberyan and Hecky, 1987; Ross, 2013a,b; Hecky and Reinthal, 2010; Ross et al., 2013, 2014, 2015. However, see also: Zhang et al., 2014).  Wauthier et al., (2012, 2015) presented evidence connecting Lake Kivu\'s continental rift environment to the extensive volcanism adjacent to it in the north and by rift-related fracturing and deep magmatic dikeintrusion to the various volcanic cones present at depths below 300 meters in the northern sector.  Volcanic plumbing in this system was activated in the 2002 eruption near to the shore of the lake, but fortunately not underneath it.  The recent work ofRoss and Wauthier and their colleagues has illuminated important aspects of Lake Kivu\'s danger.  These insights suggest degassing removal of CO.sub.2 from the deep lake will be urgently prudent to protect both human populations and Lake Kivu\'s ecosystem.', 'Commercially viable industrial utilization of CO.sub.2 in large-scale flows (that is, exceeding .about.100,000 tonnes per year) must connect sources to sinks in an economically efficient manner, either by adjacent proximity or pipeline systems. Long distance transport of CO.sub.2 can be expensive, adding a cost in the range of US$15 to $35 per tonne for compression and transport on the scale of about 500 km (Kuang et al., 2015.  For detailed analysis, see: Doctor et al., 2005).  Long distanceCO.sub.2 pipeline systems exist only in certain areas of the US and Canada (Noothout et al., 2014; Denbury, 2011; IPCC, 2005 chapter 4; Ortiz et al., 2013; Department of Energy, 2015).  The world\'s most extensive CO.sub.2 pipeline system includes almost3,000 miles of pipeline.  It connects through Denver City, NW Texas.  Denver City is the world\'s largest CO.sub.2 distribution hub (Clark, 2014).  Its pipeline network connects into another pipeline network to the south coordinated via the McCamey hub inMcCamey, Tex.  These interconnected networks distribute CO.sub.2 for enhanced oil recovery throughout the Permian Basin (EOR, Muggeridge et al., 2015; Al-Mjeni et al., 2010/2011).  The Denver City hub distributes about 30 million tonnes (MTA) of CO.sub.2per annum for EOR injection into old low-productivity oilfields to rejuvenate oil extraction (Powerplantccs, undated; Kuuskraa and Wallace, 2014; Wallace and Kuuskraa, 2014).  This CO.sub.2 mostly is obtained from natural wells: Sheep Mountain, McElmoDome and Doe Canyon in Colorado, and Bravo Dome in New Mexico.  In 2010 and 2012, a major new source of industrial CO.sub.2 came on line via Occidental petroleum\'s Century Gas Processing Plant located in Fort Stockton Tex.  located about 160 miles southof Denver City.  The Century plant added a CO.sub.2 extraction capacity exceeding 8 MTA into the hub system (Century Plant Fact Sheet, 2014; ZeroCO.sub.2, undated).  This added to other industrially-sourced CO.sub.2 input into West Texas regionalpipeline systems from a network of five CO.sub.2 sources from ammonia production and natural gas ""sweetening"" (CO.sub.2- and H.sub.2S-removal) plants developed in .about.1972.  These include the Pikes Peak, Grey Ranch, Puckett, Mitchell, and Terell gassweetening plants, plus the Val Verde ammonia plant.  This network provided the first basis for using CO.sub.2 on a large commercial-scale for EOR in the USA (Meyer, 2007; Gao et al., 2013).  Ever since, this system has piped purified CO.sub.2, between 1and 2 million tonnes per year, 132 km to a Val Verde Tex.  distribution hub for distribution for EOR use (Benson, 2015; MIT, 2015).  Detailed maps of these Permian Basin collection and distribution systems are provided by Moore (2005), Melzer (2007),Husted (2009) and Department of Energy (2015).  Beginning in 1976, supercritical CO.sub.2 was pumped .about.100 km from an ammonia plant to the Lick Creek oilfield in southern Arkansas for immiscible CO.sub.2-EOR flooding in a depleted heavy oil field(Reid et al., 1981).  An additional system utilizing anthropogenic CO.sub.2 exists in Texas near Houston.  About 1 MTA waste CO.sub.2 is captured from an industrial steam reformer hydrogen plant within the Valero refinery in Port Arthur.  This CO.sub.2is piped 159 km for EOR injection into the Hastings oil field near Houston (Haszeldine, 2015).', 'CO.sub.2 utilization for greenhouse fertilization is widespread.

A similar situation exists in Sweden linking a distillery with a tomato grower (Advantage Environment,2013).  In 2015, the company Linde Gas Turkey commissioned a CO.sub.2 purification and liquefaction plant to capture geothermal CO.sub.2 from the Zorlu Energy geothermal power plant near Denizli in order to supply an initiative to create an ""OrganizedGreenhousing Zone"" in the region (Cockerill, 2015).', 'Close proximity allows CO.sub.2 to be routed efficiently between sources and utilizers without the need to purchase land use rights, construct transport pipeline systems and pay energy costs for compressing CO.sub.2 for extended transfer. Proximity-based industrial collaborations linking CO.sub.2 producers and users are reviewed briefly in following.  Most involve urea production.  The industrial production of ammonia (NH.sub.3) creates CO.sub.2 waste via the process of methane reforming. Most of it can be cycled into the production of urea (for example: Agrium, 2015; Wikipedia: Urea; Perez-Fortes et al., 2014).  Urea is produced by combining ammonia and CO.sub.2 to form ammonium carbamate via an exothermic reaction,2NH.sub.3+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.H.sub.2NCOONH.sub.4, followed by an endothermic ""urea conversion"" dehydration reaction: H.sub.2NCOONH.sub.4.fwdarw.(NH.sub.2).sub.2CO+H.sub.2O.  Natural gas is the dominant hydrogen source input into the Haber-Bosch (Smil, 2000)and Bosch-Meiser processes for ammonia and urea production, respectively.  The carbon present in the input natural gas is mostly transformed into CO.sub.2 in the process of industrial hydrogen production.  Ammonia (NH.sub.3) is produced using theresulting hydrogen (H.sub.2).  This is done by fixing nitrogen (N.sub.2) obtained from air via Haber-Bosch synthesis: 3H.sub.2+N.sub.2.fwdarw.2NH.sub.3.', ""The Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) is creating the world's largest CO.sub.2 purification and liquefaction plant in Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia (Linde, 2013a; World of Chemicals, 2013).

It is planned that most of the CO.sub.2 eventually will be used for CO.sub.2-EOR.  Additional examples of plans for proximity CCU in heavy industry underdevelopment include: (i) Masdar City in the UAE (Masdar/Al Reyadah, undated), and (ii) possibly the Jurong Island Eco-Industrial Park in Singapore (Pan et al., 2015; For an overview analysis see: Singapore report, 2014)."", 'A team of Louisiana State University engineers focused on CCU examined the US lower Mississippi River Corridor (MRC) complex of large-scale heavy industries in chemicals and energy.  Their aim was to understand and promote opportunities forlarge-scale CCU implementation (Hertwig et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003, 2005; and Indala, 2004).  This group concluded there was substantial potential for profitability from CCU implementation coordinating CO.sub.2 flows between producers and users.  Theyespecially noted possibilities for future development based on new CCU-favorable modes of industrial chemicals production.  This hoped-for development has not yet taken place.  Nonetheless, development of networked CCU in the wider region has grownhugely by connection with CO.sub.2-EOR.  In 2011, Denbury (www.denbury.com; Schnacke, 2015) completed its .about.700 km US$1B CO.sub.2 ""Green pipeline"" network crossing the MRC.  The ""Green"" pipeline links a natural CO.sub.2 source, Jackson Dome incentral Mississippi State to EOR locations in and near Houston, Tex.  (Denbury 2009a,b; Denbury, 2011).  At present, CO.sub.2 from the Geismar La.  ammonia plant owned by Potash Corporation/PCS Nitrogen adds to CO.sub.2 flow into this pipeline.

This plant is expected to start-up in 2016 (www.kemperproject.org; Wikipedia: Kemper Project; Sarkus, 2015; Wilson, 2015).', 'Denbury\'s ""Green"" CO.sub.2 pipeline from mid-state in Mississippi to Houston Tex.  follows a CO.sub.2-EOR-focused business model.  Hasan et al., (2014) evaluated the technology and economics of CCU industrial ecology.  These authors estimated acost basis for CO.sub.2 of .about.US$40 per tonne ""captured and managed"" in the US with predominant CO.sub.2-EOR utilization.  Subground CO.sub.2 storage management in the US and Canada is beginning to link with CO.sub.2-EOR, as there is potential forfavorable economics extracting large quantities of oil left behind after conventional extraction flows have dried up (Carter, 2012; Godec et al., 2013; Kuuskraa et al., 2013: OECD/IEA, 2015; IEA, 2015, 2016).

More than 25 million tonnes of injected anthropogenic CO.sub.2already have been stored in these oilfields via CO.sub.2-EOR stimulation of oil production.  The average rate of injection has been .about.3 million tonnes (MT) CO.sub.2 per year.  About 40 to 60 MT CO.sub.2 is expected to be sequestered in the course ofextracting approximately 215 million barrels of excess oil production overall (Whittaker et al., 2011).  CO.sub.2-EOR with associated CO.sub.2 sequestration is a relatively well-developed technology in the USA.  The an overall injection rate for USCO.sub.2-EOR is about 60 million tonnes CO.sub.2 per year (MTA), circa 2015 (Hill et al., 2013).  This generates in excess of 100 million barrels per year of incremental crude oil production (NETL/DOE, 2010; Hill et al., 2013.  See Jaramillo et al.,2009, Azzolina et al., 2015 and Cooney et al., 2015, for CO.sub.2 Life Cycle Analysis, LCA, of CO.sub.2 EOR).  At present, however, for viable industrial production processes other than CO.sub.2-EOR and natural gas-based urea production, specialcircumstances and innovation appear to be required to bring together captured CO.sub.2 output availability at low cost with value-creating CCU on a large scale.', ""Plentiful rift-based oils are present in the Albertine graben in Western Uganda bordering the Eastern DRC (Lirong et al., 2004a,b; Gao, 2012; Abeinomugisha and Kasande, 2012; Karp et al., 2012).  Substantial reserves have been proven on theeastern shore of Lake Albert.  A total of .about.6.5 billion barrels is estimated for Uganda in this area (Nakhle, 2015; OIES, 2015).  Recoverable reserves are estimated at roughly 1.5 to 2 billion barrels (OIES, 2015; Nakhle, 2015; Jarrett, 2014;Powell, 2014).  Exploration blocks to the south near Rwanda bordering Lake Edward also have been drilled with substantial oils reserves discovered (URN, 2010).  Discussions of pipeline technologies for the possibility of the transport of the Albertinerift's crude to the distant East African coast indicate most oils are heavy (API .about.19 to 33), viscous (cP .about.40), and wax-rich (.about.19%).  Heating and/or solvent addition is required both for extraction and pipeline transport of this type ofcrude.  Reports suggest the oils pour only above 40.degree.  C., and will flow efficiently in pipes only above 60.degree.  C. (Jarvie et al., 2007: Deep Earth, 2015; Ochan and Amusugut, 2012; Open Oil, 2012).  Operational problems in producing andtransporting such oils include precipitative clogging by wax and asphaltene precipitation both of the reservoir during extraction, as well as pipeline clogging above ground.  Oils of this type are expensive to extract and trade at a discount.  Efficientproduction requires specialized technologies (Oil in Uganda, 2014)."", 'Oil reservoir rocks in the Albertine Graben in the region of Lake Albert typically are sandstones, often with calcium carbonate pore cementing (Ochan and Amusugut, 2012; Karp et al., 2012).', 'Hard-to-produce heavy oils are abundant worldwide.  They exist in amounts exceeding the scale of all conventional reserves prior to extraction.  Heavy oils represent a major focus of effort for development of economically viable extractivetechnologies (Chopra et al., 2010; Alboudwarej et al., 2006).  CO.sub.2-EOR typically is considered to be a technique restricted to non-heavy oils (NETL/DOE, 2010; Shell, 2012).  However, injected CO.sub.2 has long been used successfully to pressurizedepleted heavy oil fields via immiscible CO.sub.2 flooding (Gao et al., 2013; Emadi et al., 2011).  Prominent examples reviewed by Gao et al., (2013) include the Lick Creek Field in Southern Arkansas (USA, Reid and Robinson, 1981), the Wilmington Fieldnear Los Angeles, the Bati Raman field in SE Turkey (See also: Kok and Ors, 2012; Ansarizadeh et al., 2015), the Liaohe Field in NE China, and the Forest and Oropouche fields in Trinidad.  In most CO.sub.2-EOR operations, a substantial fraction ofCO.sub.2 remains sequestered in the formation.  And CO.sub.2 co-produced with oil can be separated and recycled into continuing CO.sub.2-EOR injection.  Consequently, efforts are being made to develop efficient heavy oil extraction technologies to expanduse of CO.sub.2 in heavy oil production combining extractive efficiency goals with environmental CO.sub.2 sequestration goals (Whittaker, 2015; Emadi et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013).', 'One such strategy is known as VAPEX (vapor extraction).  VAPEX has been extensively piloted in the field.  It is based on phase transformation for vapor extraction without a necessity for heat addition (Butler and Mokrys, 1991; Upreti et al.,2007).  As VAPEX technologies have developed, CO.sub.2 addition has become prominent.  VAPEX operates by the solvent action of horizontally injected solvent-gas ""vapor chambers."" These mobilize heavy oils on their expanding peripheries.  This createsflow conditions for solvent-mobilized oil migration into adjacent horizontal extraction well systems.  Efficient VAPEX injection schemes include CO.sub.2 admixed with depressurization-recoverable light hydrocarbon gas co-solvents such as propane.  Recentresults have refined understanding of this method for field applications.  In particular, recent research has found CO.sub.2 to be an optimal co-solvent with propane (Tchambak et al., 2012; Torabi et al., 2012; Jahaveri, 2013; Bayat et al., 2015a,b,c;Mohammadpoor and Torabi, 2014, 2015a,b).  A general advantage of CO.sub.2 injection under both miscible and immiscible conditions is CO.sub.2 absorption into heavy oil causing viscosity decrease and volumetric swelling.  This creates reservoirpressurization and oil mobilization, increasing extraction performance (Klins, 1982; Sahin et al., 2007, 2012; Gao et al., 2013).  Future developments are likely to utilize CO.sub.2 across a range of cost-minimized injection technologies thatsimultaneously sequester CO.sub.2 while producing heavy oils efficiently.  CO.sub.2 already can be utilized across a range of circumstances and technologies in heavy, waxy and asphaltene-rich oil production.  A key economic factor apart from the marketprice of oil is the availability large quantities of pipeline-accessible low-cost CO.sub.2 (Wei et al., 2015; Advanced Research International, 2006).', 'Examples of further innovations utilizing CO.sub.2 in EOR include: (i) Carbonated Water Injection (Shu, 1982: U.S.  Pat.

Carbonated Water Injection (CWI) has long been known to be a means of increasing reservoir porosity in carbonate host rock oil reservoirs (Holm, 1959).  Success in oil recovery enhancementfrom CO.sub.2 dissolving of carbonate host rock to increase porosity is well demonstrated in the Bati Raman field of SE Turkey (Sahin et al., 2007).

EGR research suggests it will be extended for use in the arena of ""tight gas"" (fracking-based extraction), (Li and Ellsworth, 2014; Kulga etal., 2014).', 'CO.sub.2 similarly can be utilized by injection into deep coalbed deposits as a means of enhancing the extraction fraction of coalbed methane (CBM) while simultaneously sequestering CO.sub.2 in a ""CO.sub.2-ECBM"" process (Busch and Gensterblum,2011; Godec et al., 2014; Li and Fang, 2014; Litynski et al., 2014).  The technology has been shown to be effective, especially with special reservoir development involving co-injected nitrogen and involving other technologies to avoid porosity closuredue to coal swelling from CO.sub.2 absorption.  Commercial takeoff of this form of CO.sub.2 utilization, however, appears to require a carbon tax environment with sequestration credit payments (Sloss, 2015).', 'The European CO.sub.2 Test Centre Mongstad (CO.sub.2-TCM) is located near Bergen Norway on the site of Norway\'s largest oil refinery.  A natural gas power plant is present within the industrial complex.  The CO.sub.2-TCM is one of the world\'slargest industrial joint ventures for development of large-scale CO.sub.2 capture technologies (MIT, 2015b).  CCU, however, was not a component of the venture until development of the ""CO.sub.2 to Bio Project"" in 2011-2012 (CO.sub.2BIO, 2012). CO.sub.2BIO is focused on utilizing CO.sub.2 as carbon source food input into photosynthetic algal biocultures to produce aquaculture feeds rich in the long-chain omega-3 lipids DHA and EPA.  CO.sub.2BIO project produced a report (Kleivdal et al., 2012)and a start-up company, CO.sub.2BIO AS (www.co2bio.no).  The initial agenda of the company is to create a piloting project at Mongstad.  Norway is the world\'s leading nation in production and innovation in salmon aquaculture.  Scientists and fisheriesand government leaders recognize an important long-term strategic necessity for the development of very large-scale business-viable production of algae-derived omega-3-rich aquaculture feeds, especially for salmon.  This is necessary to replaceunsustainable and escalating use of forage fish for feeds.  Escalating use of wild-caught forage fish for aquaculture/mariculture feeds is grossly harmful to the sustainability of world forage fish populations and their associated fisheries (Sorensen etal., 2011; Kleivdal et al., 2013; BlueBio, 2013; Reitan, 2013.  See also: SARF, 2014).  The Norwegian Parliament has granted US$1M to CO.sub.2BIO in a research consortium to create a 350 square meter greenhouse pilot testing facility adjacent to theMongstad CO.sub.2-TCM.  Construction was scheduled to begin in 2015 (Holm, 2015; Kleivdal, 2015).  However, CO.sub.2BIO perhaps is unlikely to create large-scale algal production operations adjacent to Mongstad.  Mongstad therefore is not an example of aCCU-focused industrial eco-park.', 'Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs, see Wikipedia entry and, Making Lewes, undated) are a widespread mode of industrial aggregation focused on systematic recycling of waste outputs into production inputs, often described by the term ""industrial ecology""(Garner and Keoleian, 1995).  To date, no EIP has been developed with a core focus on carbon capture utilization (CCU).  A few examples exist of ""industrial symbiosis"" between paired companies.  The Ulsan Eco-Industrial Park in Korea includes a linkagebetween a zinc plant producing waste CO.sub.2 and steam, and a paper plant using CO.sub.2 and steam.  These plants are connected by a 3.8 km pipeline (Park, 2013).  The Herdersbrug eco-industrial park in Belgium has qualified itself as ""carbon neutral.""However, it does not incorporate any CCU industrial activities (Block et al., 2011).  The ""Industrial Estate Moerdijk,"" in the Netherlands, includes an ""Experimental Garden."" This eco-park section connects CO.sub.2-produced in a sewage incinerator withCO.sub.2 use by the Swiss company, Omya.  Omya produces precipitated fine calcium carbonate sold into the paper industry as a whitener pigment (GreenPort, 2009).  Shell Chemicals also supplies waste CO.sub.2 to Omya at this location (Royston, 2012). ""Bioport Terneuzen"" is an eco-park located in the Dutch port of Zeeland, between Antwerp and Rotterdam.  It includes a coordinated CO.sub.2 industrial symbiosis between several CO.sub.2 and heat producers, including a Yara fertilizer plant, and a networkof adjacent commercial greenhouses, ""Glastuinbouw Terneuzen"" (WarmCO.sub.2, undated; Rijckaert, 2009; Nuhoff-Isakhanyan et al., 2015).  Iceland\'s Svartsengi Geothermal Resource Park combines geothermal power and district heating operations connected withCarbon Recycling International\'s ""George Olah CO.sub.2 to Renewable Methanol Plant"" (Prakash, 2013, 2014).  CRI\'s methanol plant utilizes electrolytic hydrogen (using geothermal power) and geothermally-derived CO.sub.2 flux from the powerplant (Hettinga,2013; Sigurbjornsson, 2013).  Industrial ecology parks based on CO.sub.2 production linked with diversified utilization have been strategized (Meylan, 2015), and modeled (Norstebo et al., 2012).  However, none thus far have been specifically designed.', 'CO.sub.2 hubs may be defined as industrial methods, designs and realizations having three main components interlinked to each other.  The first is one or more CO.sub.2 sources.  Sources may be natural, such as extraction from a drilled CO.sub.2well.  Or they may be from natural source via an industrial separation process such as removal from natural gas in natural gas upgrading.  Or CO.sub.2 sources may capture CO.sub.2 from industrial waste gas streams, for example by capture-separation ofCO.sub.2 from post-combustion exhaust of a powerplant.  Sources inputting CO.sub.2 into a hub system may involve combinations of any or all of these source types.  The second component is that which connects the first component to the third componentfocused on utilization of CO.sub.2.  This second is the core of the hub.  It is that which distributes and, if necessary beforehand separates and purifies CO.sub.2, and if necessary stores and variously, as needed, compresses and/or refrigerates, theCO.sub.2 obtained from sources.  This is a system of tanks, pumps, compressors, gas treatment facilities, valve systems and pipelines.  The third component is the sink for CO.sub.2 utilization and/or sequestration.  This involves methods, designs andrealizations which sequester and/or utilize CO.sub.2.  Utilization involves industrial and/or agricultural and/or aquacultural use for purposes gaining economic utility from consuming a supply of CO.sub.2.  Thus far, all CO.sub.2 hubs, strategized,planned or realized, principally are focused on CO.sub.2 sequestration, CO.sub.2-EOR, or greenhouse horticulture, or urea or methanol production.  With the exception of the Green Pipeline system (which is geographically dispersed over a very longdistance and is not per se a hub), no CO.sub.2 hubs yet exist where the principle focus for CO.sub.2 distribution involves a gathering together of industrial activities assembled for the purpose of waste CO.sub.2 utilization different from providingsupply for CO.sub.2-EOR alone, or for greenhouse horticulture alone, or for CO.sub.2-EOR and greenhouse horticulture in combination (as planned for the Port of Rotterdam), or for urea production alone, or for methanol production alone, or for calciumcarbonate production alone.  (For a partial global summary, see: Der, 2014, slide #9 and Haszeltine, 2015, slide 38.)', 'Rotterdam provides a city-centered model of a CO.sub.2 hub linking captured CO.sub.2 outputs from refinery and bioethanol production waste to agricultural use of CO.sub.2 in greenhouse culture of flowers and vegetables (Rotterdam ClimateInitiative, 2011; OCAP, 2012; van Engelenburg, 2012; Linde, 2013b, 2014; Ros et al., 2014; Port of Rotterdam, undated).  The Port of Rotterdam\'s distribution network handles .about.0.5 MTA CO.sub.2.  It supplies almost 600 greenhouses via a .about.300 kmnetwork of pipelines.  Greenhouse demand for the CO.sub.2, however, is seasonal whereas CO.sub.2 source output is roughly constant over time.  Plans remain uncertain for a possible major scale-up called the ROAD project.  ROAD aims to integrate theexisting CO.sub.2 hub with a new pipeline network for offshore subsea CO.sub.2 storage linked with offshore CO.sub.2-EOR (Carbon Capture Journal, 2014; Read et al., 2014; Read 2015a,b; Tillema, 2015).  The City of Rotterdam\'s agenda is to develop thelargest-scale CO.sub.2 hub in Europe.  The plan involves a network of companies called ""CINTRA,"" an acronym for ""Carbon In Transport,"" (CINTRA Factsheet, 2011).  CINTRA is part of the ROAD initiative.  ROAD is an acronym in Dutch for: ""Rotterdam captureand storage demonstration."" It is a sub-unit of the Rotterdam Climate Initiative (Tillema, 2015; Read, 2015a,b; van Tongeren, 2011; Radgen, 2015; Read et al., 2014; Neele et al., 2014; Singh and Haines, 2014; www.rotterdamclimateinitiative.nl; IEAGHG,2015).  The agenda for the CINTRA consortium is: (i) to create the Port of Rotterdam CO.sub.2 hub linking incoming CO.sub.2 from a network of onshore pipelines into a network of subsea offshore CO.sub.2 pipelines, and (ii) also to create a capacity forloading of liquified CO.sub.2 onto transport ships docking in the Port of Rotterdam (Loeve et al., 2013), and into the tanks of tanker trucks for road deliveries.', 'Creation of the type of capacity the Port of Rotterdam plans for diversified CO.sub.2 delivery requires a compression pumping station with temporary storage for pressurized CO.sub.2, as well as a refrigeration-liquefaction plant and adjacentstorage tanks for liquid CO.sub.2 sufficient in volume to allow rapid loading onto transport ships (Groensmit, 2010; van der Ben, 2011; de Wolff et al., 2013).  An engineering overview for a CO.sub.2 hub operating in a port is provided by Suzuki et al.,(2013).', ""The Belgian Port of Antwerp is developing plans to reproduce Rotterdams's example.  Antwerp hosts the largest integrated refinery complex in Europe (Callebaut, 2015).  Most other European initiatives for large-scale CCU, are focused on CCS,variously linking North Sea CO.sub.2 sequestration-storage together with CO.sub.2-EOR opportunities.  These efforts are reviewed by Kjarstad et al., (2014), Brownsort et al., (2015), and Scottish Enterprise--SCCS, (undated)."", 'Links between CO.sub.2 emitters and CO.sub.2 utilization for greenhouse fertilization are widespread.  Greenfield Specialty Alcohols (www.gfsa.com) of Chatham, Ontario (Canada) operates in a local industrial symbiosis with the greenhouse tomatogrower Truly Green Farms (http://www.trulygreenfarms.ca).  Ethanol production provides waste heat and CO.sub.2 to the greenhouses (Jessen, 2013; GreenEnergyFutures, 2014).  A similar situation exists in Sweden linking a distillery with a tomato grower(Advantage Environment, 2013).  In 2015, the company Linde Gas Turkey commissioned a CO.sub.2 purification and liquefaction plant to capture geothermal CO.sub.2 from the Zorlu Energy geothermal power plant near Denizli to supply an initiative to createan ""Organized Greenhousing Zone"" in the region (Cockerill, 2015).', 'Temporary CO.sub.2 storage associated with utilization is required for ""dry fracking"" of oil and gas extraction wells with CO.sub.2.  Injections of CO.sub.2 to dry frack a single well may require up to 6,000 tonnes of CO.sub.2 (Sears and Feve,2014).  Stored CO.sub.2, if in refrigerated liquid form, typically is reheated before subterranean injection (Liebscher et al., 2013).', 'Capabilities for cryogenic capture and storage of gases can be an important mode in advanced powerplant operations.  Cryogenic capturing of CO.sub.2 can be useful for purification of input natural gas containing associated CO.sub.2 in additionto being an effective means of capturing CO.sub.2 in post-combustion exhaust.  Cryocapture and storage of various gases, including O.sub.2, N.sub.2, CO.sub.2, CH.sub.4 and air, can be used as a means of high-efficiency power storage via Cryogenic EnergyStorage, CES (see: Wikipedia entry: Cryogenic Energy Storage; www.highview-power.com; Highview Power Storage, 2014, 2017; www.dearman.co.uk; Center for Low Carbon Futures, 2013; Strahan, 2013; Brett and Barnett, 2014; Abdo et al., 2015; Morgan et al.,2015; Starns et al., 2015; Liquid Air Energy Network, undated; Tweed, 2015; www.keukaenergy.com; Zhang et al., 2015a,b; Chen et al., 2009; www.sesinnovation.com; Baxter, 2015, 2015 video, 2016a,b; Baxter et al., 2016; Safdarnejad et al., 2015; U.S.  Pat.

Cryogenic production of such liquified gases by an AirSeparation Unit (ASU) equipped with adjunct CES power generators can allow a powerplant to store and release energy as needed in order to vary its sales electricity output over time while producing power from its main power source at a continuous rate ofoutput, if desired.  If a powerplant operates with air cryo-processing, as for example an oxyfuel powerplant does to provide O.sub.2 gas into combustion, then such a powerplant can use CES to modulate its disposition of electric power over time.  Theplant uses its power output ""internally"" to build-up stored cryoenergy reserves.  It then converts these cryo-energy reserves in times of high demand (and high prices) in order to maximize sales of electric power.  CES systems store cryogenicallyliquified gases in one or more thermally insulated reservoirs.  Additionally, a powerplant with cryogenic energy storage capacities can provide valuable grid-balancing services both for power intake and output.  These can be useful especially forincorporation of renewable power inputs into an electric power grid.  Wind and solar inputs, as well as small- and micro-hydropower inputs, often are highly irregular and unpredictable in time and scale.', 'Both liquefied oxygen and nitrogen are produced by an ASU if it is of the cryogenic type.  Both gases can be sold as pressurized bottled and/or cryogenic gas products.  Both can be utilized for cryogenic energy storage for electric power outputmodulation.  Uses for pressurized or liquefied oxygen are many.  Uses for pressurized and/or cold liquefied N.sub.2 also are many.  They include: (i) cooling-refrigeration, such as of a data center, or for transportation cooling food storage in trucks;(ii) fumigation of stored crops or of horticultural greenhouses overnight (by blowing-in an N.sub.2 or N.sub.2--CO.sub.2 atmosphere to asphyxiate oxygen-respiring pests) with or without cooling; (ii) N.sub.2-EOR, ""waterless"" N.sub.2-fracking, and""waterless"" N.sub.2 cryogenic fracking (Higgins, 2015; Cai et al., 2015; Cha et al., 2015; Crawford, 2015); (iii) solvent switching in switchable ionic liquids using CO.sub.2 as a switching gas and N.sub.2 for return; (iv) canopy gas for algal biomassproduction in situations where avoidance of atmospheric O.sub.2 is desired; (v) sparging gas for removal of O.sub.2 and/or CO.sub.2 from solution (Al-Mashhadani et al., 2012); (vi) numerous medical and laboratory uses; (vii) rapid deep freezing of foods;(viii) a carrier gas for chemically reducing uses of carbon monoxide, for example tin smelting; (ix) input into the production of chemicals, for example ammonia and urea; (x) for humane animal slaughter, (xi) pressurizing gas input for beer preparation,and (xii) cryogenic energy storage (CES).', 'Both gaseous and liquefied nitrogen gas (LN.sub.2) is a byproduct of air separation by cryogenic air separation units used to obtain separated oxygen for purposes such as oxyfuel combustion.  In the process of air separation, liquefied nitrogenis used to cool incoming air via heat exchange processes.  This recycles cryo-energy and creates waste flows of pure N.sub.2 gas that can be utilized.  Excess liquid nitrogen also is created as a waste in so far as it does not need to be saved for use inoxycombustion.  It can be vented to the atmosphere.  This can be done as a means of generating electricity, utilizing cryo-energy.  A power-generating turbine based on LN.sub.2 runs by the expansion of liquid nitrogen into gas consequent of heat exchangewith the ambient atmosphere.  It uses the same logic and design as liquid air engines and power generators (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_energy_storage; www.dearman.co.uk; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogenvehicle).

Baxter of Brigham Young University, and several university collaborators and co-workers in a start-up company, SES Innovation (www.sesinnovation.com), have developed commercialized technologies for efficient cryogenic captureof CO.sub.2 from coal-based power plant flue gases.  Baxter\'s technologies connect CO.sub.2 capture and storage with powerplant cryogenic energy storage.  They allow the powerplant to operate with an efficient stable power output over 24 hour cycleswhile maximizing the sale of electricity at times of high demand (and higher sales price), minimizing electricity sales at times of lower demand (and lower sales prices).  Such output variability can be supported by using electricity internally tobuild-up cryogenic coolant reserves at times of lower demand within the 24 hour cycle.  Stored cryogenic reserves of cryo-energy then are utilized to produce power at times of high demand.  Systems designed by SES Innovation also allow dry iceproduction, refrigeration of natural gas into LNG, and utilization of liquid nitrogen for power production in the case of power plants linked with Air Separation Units (ASUs) such as oxyfuel power plants (Baxter, 2015, 2016a,b; Safdarnejad et al., 2015;Fazlollahi et al., 2015; Ebrahimzadeh, 2016; Ebrahimzadeh, et al., 2016; a,b; Fazlollahi, 2016; Jensen et al., 2015; http://www.sesinnovation.com/technology/carbon_capture/ES/; Baxter, U.S.  Pat.

Progress to date suggests it may be capable of being scaled to a minimum .about.2000 TPD output size moduleneeded for clean coal oxyfuel powerplants (Repasky et al., 2012, 2013a,b, 2014; Anderson et al., 2011, 2015).', 'CCU is well developed in the greenhouse horticulture industry.  It provides the carbon feed source for accelerated photosynthesis at enhanced CO.sub.2 concentrations, typically 2.times.  to 3.times.  the present atmospheric concentration of 400ppm (dry air molecular mole fraction).  In the interval 1998 and 2003, the Dutch company Ecofys developed a ""closed"" greenhouse model incorporating a powerplant within the greenhouse system producing electric power, heat and CO.sub.2 (Opdam et al., 2005;et al., 2005; Gelder et al., 2005).  This created a CCU business model based on combining CO.sub.2 production for horticulture with natural gas electric power generation using small powerplants installed individually within greenhouse complexes.  The newmode of high-efficiency greenhouse horticulture spread rapidly (van der Veen, 2012).  General Electric (GE), Cummins Engine, and Rolls Royce all offer natural gas-powered combined heat and power (CHP) generator systems for greenhouse use.  These systemsgenerate electrical power for greenhouse and heating and lighting and other operations.  They also provide CO.sub.2 from the engine\'s exhaust plus waste heat.  Engine exhaust is cleaned of CO and nitrogen oxides (GE, undated; Commercial GreenhouseGrower, 2012).  In the Netherlands, greenhouse businesses using CHP systems sell excess power locally or into the grid (Tasin, 2005; Campernolle et al., 2011; Clarke Energy, undated; Yates, 2012; De Wit, 2014; Power Engineering, 2014; GE, undated).  CHPexemplifies profitable CCU.  At cold times of the year when greenhouses need heat and often use artificial lighting, systems can have close to 100% utilization of the total chemical energy of the natural gas utilized by the CHP engine power generator. One example of a CHP user is the Dutch tomato growers cooperative ""Prominent Growers"" (District Energy, 2015).  Another is the very large Thanet Earth greenhouse complex in SE England.  Thanet Earth combines three different greenhouse companies, togetherutilizing GE CHP systems for combined power, heat and CO.sub.2 (WSGA, undated).  Another example is greenhouse tomato grower Springhill Nursery near Evesham in England.  Springhill powers its CHP powerplant with biogas from on-site anaerobic digestion(HDC, 2014).  Wright Salads, Ltd., of the Isle of Wight is another UK-based greenhouse grower using CHP systems (36 MW), (Bower, 2013).  A prominent example in the USA and Canada is Houweling\'s Tomatoes.  Howelings operates GE CHP-based greenhouses inSouthern California (Yates, 2012) and BC Canada (Houwelings, undated).  In 2014, Houwelings built a third high-tech greenhouse in Mona, Utah.  This greenhouse is linked with power, waste CO.sub.2 and heat from an adjacent power plant burning natural gas(Houweling\'s, 2014, undated; Abcarian, 2015).

It became the dominant refrigerant for 100 years (Kim at al., 2004; Pearson, 2005; Austin and Sumathy, 2011; Harris, 2014).  For over 75 years it has been knownthat heat engine CO.sub.2 power cycles (that is, heat engines using CO.sub.2 as a thermodynamic ""working fluid"") are potentially hyper-efficient and have great potential (Hochstein, 1940; Angelino, 1968; Feher, 1968; Yantovskii et al., 1993, 2009; Wallet al., 1995; Ausubel, 1999, 2004; Dostal et al., 2004; Bahamonde Noriega, 2012; Kim et al., 2012; DOE/NETL, 2012; Wright, 2012).  Possibilities include fossil-fueled open system turbine power.  Closed-cycle heat engine applications of CO.sub.2 powercycle technology include solar-thermal power converters, nuclear power systems, geothermal power systems, hyper-efficient jet engines, and solar-electric propulsion (Brown, 2000; Ahn et al., 2015; Ausubel, 2004; Daniels, 2015; Colonna, 2016; Schuwer,2015; Neises and Turchi, 2014; Rochau, 2011, 2014; Cleanenergyauthority, 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Wright, 2012; Wright et al., 2012; http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/supercritical-co2/; McClung et al., 2014; Tahil, 2014; Yeom, 2015; USDOE,undated).  The expected advantages of commercial development of CO.sub.2 power cycle heat engines using supercritical CO.sub.2 are astonishing.  They include powerplant thermal efficiency boosting to .about.70% with radical reduction in the volumetricsize and complexity, hence cost, of turbo machinery.  The volume of space taken up by machinery can be decreased by roughly a factor of .about.100.  This is consequent of a much higher density of the jetting supercritical fluid that transfers its flowmomentum into the extracted rotational power of spinning turbine blade systems.  Cost reduction scaling eventually should be by a factor of .about.x0.1 or better (Rochau, 2014; Wright, 2012).  Environmental advantages also are impressive via thepossibility of compact Zero Emissions Power Plants (ZEPPs).  These provide streams of nearly pure CO.sub.2 waste for utilization and sequestration without any necessity for complicated, costly and energy-absorbing ""CO.sub.2 capture"" from powerplantexhaust (Yantovskii et al., 1993; Ausubel, 1999; 2004; Foy and Yantovski, 2006; Yantovsky et al., 2009).  In an oxyfueled ZEPP, whether using a supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle or not, the exhaust is a mixture of CO.sub.2 and condensable water suchthat ""CO.sub.2 capture"" is unnecessary.

An oxyfuel turbine system burning natural gas with very high associated CO.sub.2 and highly compressed intakerepresents an open supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle system.  (NB: a non-combusting working fluid is needed to keep turbine temperatures low enough to be within an operational range.  For combustion of pure methane with pure oxygen, the ""flame"" is toohot for containment and momentum transfer by flow through turbine fan blades.) The CO.sub.2 concentration in methane fuel input gas in high thermal efficiency operations may exceed 93% by mass in a two-component fueling mixture.  Water vapor alsooperates as an effective working liquid.  Oxyfuel turbines utilizing an infeed of O.sub.2 plus a CH.sub.4+(CO.sub.2+H.sub.2O) fuel mix exhaust a hot mixture of CO.sub.2+steam.  This may be used for various purposes directly or with various degrees ofcondensation of the water vapor.', 'Oxyfuel turbine systems operating commercially in the oil and gas arena have been developed by the US company Clean Energy Systems (www.CleanEnergySystems.com) in partnership with the German technology giant Siemens, and in concert with salesand field implementation by the Danish oil and gas production company Maersk Oil (Anderson, 2001; Anderson and Bischoff, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014; Siemens and Clean Energy Systems, 2006, 2012; Husted, 2009; Devanna, 2007, 2011,2012, 2013; MacAdam and Anderson, 2007; MacAdam et al., 2007; Kapteijn et al., 2011, 2012; Clean Energy Systems, 2012; Hollis et al., 2012; Peters, 2012; Hende and Bek-Pedersen, 2012; Pronske, 2013; Alford, 2014; Maersk Oil, 2012, 2013; Maslin, 2014;Henni, 2014; Maersk Oil and CES, undated; www.cleanenergysystems.com; Several presentations and videos may be viewed at http://trigen.propeoplelabs.com).  Maersk\'s initial ""Trigen"" system is a modified 43 MW Siemens turbine.  Its power rating has beenincreased to .about.150 MW running in oxyfuel mode with high-CO.sub.2 fuel gas.  The modified turbine is known as an ""OFT900"" (Clean Energy Systems, 2012 video).', 'A turbine system for power generation combining oxyfuel combustion with a supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle (hence with a highly compressed CO.sub.2-rich fuel infeed) is being developed for application for various fuels, including natural gas,by a consortium including NET Power (https://netpower.com), 8 Rivers Capital, CB&I, Exelon, and the turbine-specialized Japanese technology giant Toshiba (Lu, 2014; Isles, 2014; Dodge, 2014; NET Power, 2013, 2015; Toshiba, 2013, 2014; Sasaki, 2014;Davison, 2015; 8 Rivers, 2015; Lignite Energy Council, 2015; Iwai and Itoh, 2015; Iwai et al., 2015).  The technology is known as the ""Allam cycle."" It was developed by the British inventor Rodney John Allam, OBE, winner of the 2012 Global Energy Prize(Allam, 2013; Allam et al., 2013, 2014; Allam et al., 2013: U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,596,075, System and method for high efficiency power generation using a carbon dioxide circulating working fluid; Global Energy Prize, 2012, 2013; BBC, 2013).  Allam cycle heatengines represent a massive breakthrough innovation for power generation efficiency, system cost, and environmental advantages.  The Allam cycle uses CO.sub.2 inflow as a powerful efficiency advantage.  It therefore inverts the usual problem that highCO.sub.2 inflow with methane fuel causes a decrease of power generation efficiency.  Allam cycle power generating systems include two design types: (i) a single turbine version (Allam et al., 2013) and (ii) a double turbine version (Allam et al., 2014). Several additional patents by Allam and colleagues have been granted under 8 Rivers Capital, LLC as assignee.  The design recycles exhaust CO.sub.2 into the oxyfueled infeed gas flow.  Thermal efficiency for natural gas fueling (including oxygengeneration) with this exhaust recycling is expected to be .about.59% (Tata, 2015).  While Allam cycle technology is novel and advanced, capital costs for powerplants are expected to decrease because of the simplification and miniaturization effects ofthe supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle on turbine components.', ""Supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle heat engines are a promising new technology with wide application and a high technological readiness level.  Echogen's line of closed-cycle engines entered the commercial power sector in .about.2014.  Fieldtesting of Toshiba's 50 MW natural gas Allam cycle turbine engine is scheduled for .about.2016.  Toshiba's system, if successful, will offer CO.sub.2 outputs suitable for Carbon Capture Sequestration (CCS) and Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU), --awinning combination.  Supercritical CO.sub.2 cycle heat engines offers participants entry into a new greentech power economy via a fundamentally superior technology relative to the classic use of steam in heat engines that has energized theindustrialization revolution for over 300 years (Irfan, 2015).  Linked with CCS and CCU, supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle technologies offer the possibility of widescale success of strategies developed in the EU over the past decade to develop ZEPPs:zero emissions electric power plants burning fossil fuels (cf., http://www.zeroemissionsplatform.eu/about-zep.html; ZEP, 2006, 2007; Hage, 2007).  These technologies also represent a key step towards practical CCS in the US power generation sector.  Theyhave been recognized accordingly in overviews of the US Department of Energy's most recent Technology Readiness Assessment (DOE/NETL, 2015), and in its latest Quadrennial Technology Review (DOE, 2015a,b; Daniels, 2015; Orr, 2015;http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/turbines/super- critical-co2-power-cycles; http://energy.gov/supercritical-co2-tech-team).  The USDOE has supported the commercial realization of innovative oxyfuel turbine technologies since 2000(Siemens, 2006; MacAdam and Anderson, 2007; Dennis, 2014).  A global overview of research activities on supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycles is provided in the PhD thesis of Monge (2014)."", 'Additional modes of CO.sub.2 utilization are many and varied.', 'CO.sub.2 can be utilized to increase the value of coffee exports using a CO.sub.2 packaging atmosphere.  In comparison with green coffee stored in the traditional way in jute bags, bagging in sealed CO.sub.2-filled bags has been demonstrated toincrease quality evaluation scores for green coffee.  Evaluation was made for specialty grade status after 12 months storage in hermetically sealed bags injected with CO.sub.2 (Borem et al., 2013; Ribero et al., 2011).', 'CO.sub.2 has long been used as an asphyxiating and poisoning agent for insect pests.  It is especially useful as a non-pesticide ""organic"" agent for fumigation of silos and other harvest storage containers (Jay, 1971; Jay & Pearman, 1973; Ryan,2008a; Timlick, 2014).  CO.sub.2 is applied either directly as an asphyxiant, or together with low O.sub.2 (Neven 2003), or in combination with other specific poisoning agents such as phosphine (ECO.sub.2FUME: Wilson, 2001; Cytec, undated; Valizadegan etal., 2014), ethyl formate (Vapormate.TM.: Ryan and Bishop, 2003; Linde, undated), ethanol vapor (Arevalo-Galarza et al., 2010) and various insecticides (ENVIROSOL, Ryan, 2008b).  CO.sub.2 is widely used in Thailand as a storage insecticide applied toplastic-sealed bag stacks of rice (FFTC, 2004).  This method also has been tested with excellent results in Spain (Rudevets et al., 2009; Pons et al., 2010) and Portugal (Carvalho et al., 2012).  Grain storage utilizing CO.sub.2 pest-control is practicedin China on large scale (Daolin et al., 2007), especially in combination with phosphine (Boaxing, 2008).  Plastic silo bags are the world\'s newest grain storage technology.  The world\'s largest storage facility using this technology is in Sudan.  Silobags are advertised to be pest-resistant.  This is because grain respiration inside them uses up oxygen which is transformed into CO.sub.2.  This automatically creates a gas environment that kills insects (GrainSaver, undated).  However, this processdoes not stop early infestations before CO.sub.2 build-up.  Direct injection of a CO.sub.2 atmosphere into grain-filled silo bags before sealing has been demonstrated to be a successful insecticidal method by Milanesio, (2010, cited in Cardoso et al.,2012).', 'Vapormate.TM.  is a combination of CO.sub.2 with ethyl formate, noted above.  It is widely used for insecticidal treatment of fresh fruit, vegetables and other commodities prepared for export (Linde, 2014).  ECO.sub.2FUME is fumigant gascomprised of CO.sub.2 with 2% phosphine gas (Cytec, undated).', ""CO.sub.2 also has been developed as a solvent-propellent for outdoor industrial spraying of pyrethrum as a natural biological insecticide (Trade names: Pestigas, Turbocide, SupaPy.  Ryan et al., 2015; www.supagas.com.au).  This use was pioneeredby the Tasmanian company Botanical Resources Australia, BRA.  BRA is the world's largest pyrethrum grower (Ryan et al., 2015; http://www.botanicalra.com.au).  CO.sub.2 utilization relates to pyrethrum-based organic insecticide production in three ways. First, growth of Pryrethrum chrysanthemum plants (Tanacetum cinerariifolium) is enhanced substantially by CO.sub.2 addition, with increased pyrethrin yield per plant and shortened the period of growth to harvest (Suraweera et al., 2015).  Second,high-pressure CO.sub.2 is used for extraction and refining of the insecticidal components in the dried flowers (details provided below).  Third, pyrethrum insecticides may be purveyed in bottles of pressurized CO.sub.2 acting as both a solvent andpropellant, as noted above."", 'CO.sub.2 has been proposed and tested as an overnight insecticidal fumigant for greenhouse horticulture in concentrations up to .about.10% without harm to tomatoes.  This method has demonstrated a .about.50% kill rate on aphids (Goerke et al.,2005).  It can be used in combination with N.sub.2 for atmospheric replacement to exclude oxygen.  This method has been used for fumigation to kill snails in orchid greenhouse culture (Pontaweesap et al., 2011).  It is likely to be highly potent moregenerally for insecticidal fumigation.', 'CO.sub.2 can be used for cold sterilization of milk, beer and juices by ""cold pasteurization"" (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2007; Spilimbergo et al., 2011; King, 2014).  This method functions by means of ""dense phase"" CO.sub.2 chemical interactionunder high-pressure and without heat addition.  High pressure dense phase CO.sub.2 destroys the cell membranes of bacteria and/or yeast.  The method was developed and tested for cold pasteurization of beer by the research group of Murat Balaban at theUniversity of Florida (Folkes, 2004; Dagan and Balaban, 2006; Balaban: U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,994,878B2; Balaban and Ferrentino, 2012).  Balaban\'s work was done in association with commercialization by Praxair of a nearly identical method forcold-pasteurizing orange juice under process trademark ""Better Than Fresh.TM."" (Connery et al., 2005; Kincal et al., 2005; Fabroni et al. 2010).  Taste testing showed no distinguishable taste differences from unpasteurized beer.', 'Many studies have validated the use of dense phase CO.sub.2 for sterilization-pasteurization of milk without application of heat (Hotchkiss et al 2006: U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,041,327 B2; Werner and Hotchkiss, 2006; Hotchkiss et al., 2006; Damar andBalaban, 2006; Di Giacomo et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2011; Hongmai et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2015; Bonnaillie and Tomasula, 2015; Ceni et al., 2016).  This technology is fully ready for industrial application in situations where large quantities offood grade CO.sub.2 are available at low cost (Hagemeyer et al., 2013: U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,563,067 B2).  Low pressure CO.sub.2 also is used as a milk preservative both for refrigerated raw milk (de los Reyes-Gavilan et al., 2005).  It also is used inmodified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to extend the shelf-life of pasteurized milk (Hotchkiss et al., 1999; Singh et al., 2011).  CO.sub.2 is a superior input for optimization-modification of the pH of milk for cheesemaking (Air Liquide, undated),', 'Apple juice (Ferrintio et al., 2009; Yuk et al., 2010), carrot juice (Park et al., 2002) coconut water (Damar et al., 2009) and tomato paste (Parton et al., 2007) similarly can be sterilized by cold processing under pressure with dense phaseCO.sub.2.', 'Low-pressure CO.sub.2 is utilized as a packing preservative in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) of many types of food (Linde, undated; WITT, undated; Wikipedia: Modified atmosphere).  Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) utilizes CO.sub.2 toextend the freshness timescale of various fruits and vegetables, often in combination with low O.sub.2 (Mattos et al., 2012).  Two examples where packaging in a CO.sub.2-enriched (and low-O.sub.2) atmosphere is known to add substantially to shelf-lifeand flavor development are mangos (Galvis et al., 2005; Ullah et al., 2009) and avocados (Kassim et al., 2013).  Enhanced CO.sub.2 is believed to suppress Krebs cycle enzyme reactions in these and other fruits (Kader, 1986).', ""CO.sub.2 is a well-developed plant fertilizer input in greenhouse horticulture (Enoch and Kimball, 1986; Atwell et al., 1999; BOC, undated; Jablonski et al., 2002; De Gelder et al., 2012, 2014; Bishop et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2015).  Thescale of the effect of CO.sub.2 enhancement depends broadly on whether the plant utilizes a C3 or a C4 photosynthetic system (Taub, 2010; Sage and Zhu, 2011).  Gains in C3 plants tend to be large.  Sometimes they exceed a .times.2 yield doubling.  Gainsfrom CO.sub.2 use in typical greenhouse-grown C3 crop yields range from about a third for cucumbers and tomatoes (Atwell et al., 1999; Dannehl at al., 2013) to 60% for roses (BOC, undated; Beeson and Graham, 1991).  Greenhouse technology gains,especially the development of low-ventilation quasi-closed systems, have driven a yield increase trend over decades.  The trend is due to gains from growth under enhanced CO.sub.2.  Yields for tomatoes in Dutch greenhouses, for example, have more thandoubled in two decades between 1983 and 2013: from .about.280 tonnes of fresh tomatoes per hectare per year to .about.625 tonnes (de Gelder et al., 2012, 2014; Selina, 2015).  C3 tubers are expected to have an especially strong root crop yield responseto enhanced CO.sub.2 (Miglietta et al., 2000).  For example, cassava root dry mass more than doubles with exposure to CO.sub.2.about.1.5.times.  atmospheric (Rosenthal et al., 2012).  Other C3 tubers, such as Irish potatoes also respond to CO.sub.2fertilization with strongly enhanced growth (Haverkort et al., 2013; Miglietta et al., 2000), sometimes as high as .times.2 (NIPCC, 2014).  Sweet potato enhancements can be doubled (Czeck, 2014).  Carrots, radishes and turnips exhibit tuber mass yieldincreases up to doubling (Idso and Kimball, 1989; Azam et al., 2013).  Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), a C3 plant, yields increase by more than 40% (Mauney et al., 1994).  Ginger root (rhizome) mass more than doubles (Gaasemzadeh and Jaafar, 2011).  Theyield of the herb thyme (Thymus vulgaris) is more than doubled when grown under enhanced CO.sub.2 (Tisserat, 2002).  Thyme's active herbal substance thymol, when grown in air with ultra-highly enriched CO.sub.2, exhibited 317.times.  the concentration ofthymol compared to thyme shoots grown in identical conditions except under normal atmospheric CO.sub.2 (Tisserat and Vaughn, 2001).  Yields from orange trees (C3) double (Kimball, 2013).  Dutch growers claim eggplant (C3) yields are doubled (Rijckaert,2009).  Common beans (C3) exhibit yield gains of 77% under enhanced CO.sub.2 (Bunce, 2014).  Onion crops exhibit increases from 32% to 44% (Daymondi et al., 1997).  Grape (C3) yields increase 36% (Kurooka et al., 1990).  Orchid horticulture utilizesCO.sub.2 in various special ways relating to the specialized ways orchids use CO.sub.2 biologically via Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, CAM, with nocturnal carbon uptake (Gouk et al., 1997, 1999; Yong et al., 1999; Drennan and Nobel, 2000; Hew and Yong,2004; Texiera da Silva, 2013).  Some growth increase effects in orchids from extreme CO.sub.2 enrichment have been observed to exceed a factor of twenty (Norikane et al., 2013).  Vanilla (Vanila planifolia) is an orchid crop with obligate CAM metabolism. It is grown extensively in Uganda and Madagascar.  Rice, a C3 plant, exhibits enhancements of .about.20 to 35% with strong variability by both cultivar and temperature condition (Wang et al., 2015; Hasegawa et al., 2013; Baker et al., 1990).  Some USstrains have shown crop yield increases as high as 71% with elevated CO.sub.2 (Baker, 2004).  C4 corn/maize yield enhancements are substantial only in relation to increased drought resistance and fertilizer levels (Bunce, 2014).  Enhanced sugarproduction from sugar cane (C4) with enhanced CO.sub.2 is in in the range of .about.20 to 30% (Madan et al., 2014).  Banana and plantain (C3) biomass gains increase very strongly with CO.sub.2 enrichment (Schaeffer at al., 1996, 1999).  However, nodetailed studies of fruit yields are published.  The C3 bamboo species Aulonemia aristulata exhibits a very strong CO.sub.2 effect with approximate doubling of biomass growth (Grambone-Guarantini et al., 2013).  Seedlings of the C3 tree speciesEucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus cladocalyx F. Muell., also exhibit approximate doubling of biomass accretion with enhanced CO.sub.2 (Conroy et al., 1992; Gleadow et al., 1998).  Similarly, oil palm seedlings show very strong biomass growth response toexcess CO.sub.2.  Photosynthesis rates are observed to triple with 3.times.  atmospheric CO.sub.2 (Ibrahim et al., 2010; Jaafar and Ibrahim, 2012; Ibrahim and Jaafar, 2012).  Banana, for which waste can be used for paper production (Hussain and Tarar,2014), is now grown commercially in greenhouses on a scale from 100 to 5,000 hectares per country in: the Canary Islands, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Israel and Cyprus (Gubbuk and Pekmezci, 2004)."", ""Spain's large complex of greenhouses on the Mediterranean coast linked with a desalination plant near Almeria exemplifies the development of economic clustering dynamics in greenhouse horticulture (Perez-Mesa et al., 2015; Pardossi et al., 2004;FAO, 2013).  About 30,000 hectares are under greenhouse cultivation adjacent to Almeria (Jackson, 2015; Pardossi et al., 2004).  Annual revenues average about US$90,000 per hectare (Hortidaily, 2014).  Greenhouse horticulture has a long record of successin boosting economic development in the Almeria region (Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2011).  Greenhouse horticulture also has been a source of agro-industrialization in developing countries.  Columbia is well known for a landmark early success in developingflower exports (McQuaid, 2011).  Columbia's example has been followed by Mexico, Morocco, Kenya, and Ethiopia.  Kenya now has three agri-export clusters: fish, coffee and greenhouse-grown flowers.  Mexico has developed three fruit clusters in avocados,lemons and pineapples in addition to extensive greenhouse cultivation of tomatoes (Galvez-Nogales, 2010; Selina, 2015).  China has been the most rapid large-scale developer of greenhouse production for food production.  Almost 4 million hectares areestimated to be under some form of greenhouse protection in China (Yang, 2015).  Ghana is considering developing high intensity greenhouse vegetables production with advisory assistance from Dutch expertise of Wageningen University (Saavedra et al.,2014).  South Africa and Australia are also building-up their agriculture sectors in greenhouse production by collaboration with Dutch experts (de Visser and Dijkxhoorn, 2011; Bundock, 2010).  Burney et al., (2010) have advocated agriculturalintensification as an excellent strategy for CO.sub.2 utilization for mitigation of atmospheric CO.sub.2 build-up.  Greenhouse horticulture, especially using CO.sub.2 fertilization into new closed system air handling technologies, is potentially anattractive way to utilize CO.sub.2 while simultaneously boosting food security and exports in developing countries.  Greenhouse horticulture also can offer an attractive mode of labor market industrialization for farmers who have an innate appreciationfor, and understanding of, plant cultivation.  However, low-cost CO.sub.2 typically is unavailable in developing countries."", 'The amount of CO.sub.2 input for use in greenhouse horticulture relates to several variables.  These include especially the desired degree of enhancement over atmospheric concentration and the rate of ventilation of air into and out of thegreenhouse (Nederhoff, 2004).  Some rough numbers are: (i) from the OCAP distribution network in Rotterdam (OCAP, 2012): .about.400,000 tonnes CO.sub.2 in a year supplied .about.2,000 heactares of greenhouses for an average utilization of .about.200tonnes per hectare per year; and (ii) from Nederhoff (2004) in New Zealand: .about.7.5 grams CO.sub.2 per square meter per hour averaged over a 24-hour basis with a high-productivity focus: .about.660 tonnes per hectare per year.  Therefore, for 10,000hectares, (a square: 10 km.times.10 km), an intermediate usage of .about.400 tonnes CO.sub.2 per hectare per year sums to .about.4 million tonnes CO.sub.2 utilization per year.  Edwards (2008) provides a detailed treatment of CO.sub.2 utilization ingreenhouses based on the bio-intake basis of plant photosynthesis.', 'The use of CO.sub.2 in the cultivation of medicinal ginseng root demonstrates a different type of biotechnological horticulture focused on very high value products.  North American ginseng root takes several years to grow in the wild or undercultivation.  It sells wholesale to Asian processors for a price exceeding US$2,000 per kilogram (Maher, 2014).  Ali et al., (2005) demonstrated rapid growth of ginseng root tips in CO.sub.2-enriched bioreactors, with strong increase in production of thespecific phenolic substances desired for medicinal use.  Ginseng also has been grown industrially in cell culture suspensions since the 1990s (Yesil-Celiktas et al., 2010; Thanh et al., 2014).  CO.sub.2 used in this manner acts as a stressor rather thanas a photosynthetic carbon source in ginseng root growth in bioreactors (Kim et al., 2002).', 'Coffee plantlets have been grown in mass culture in enhanced CO.sub.2 photoautotrophic conditions (Afreen et al. 2002), for example in temporary root immersion bioreactors by the company Nestle (Ducos wt al., 2007).', 'The anti-malarial drug artemisinin is produced by the plant, Artemisia annua L. Mass propagations of high-producing clones of this plant use an acclimatization step involving photoautotrophic growth with CO.sub.2-enriched air (Supaibulwattana etal., 2011).  The use of CO.sub.2 in photoautotrophic micropropagation of plants is a well-known horticultural biotechnology (e.g., Hayadhi et al., 1993; Xiao et al., 2011).  This technology uses CO.sub.2-enriched air for transitioning and ""hardening""young plants to survive post the changeover from heterotrophy to photoautotrophy.  This can be done in so-called mist bioreactors.  These bioreactors create rooted plantlets on a mass scale from liquid mass cultures of cell-derived plant embryo clones(Fei and Weathers, 2014).  An example of a company producing agricultural products via this method is Rootec (www.rootec.com).', 'Potentially a very large scale use for CO.sub.2 is as a carbon source in the production of microalgae (both prokaryotic cyanobacterial algae and eukaryotic algae, both microalgae and macroalgae).  Algae is produced for various uses ranging frombiofertilizer and beneficial crop innoculant (Benemann, 1979; Connelly, 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Prasanna et al., 2015; Rana et al., 2015; Renuka et al., 2015), to bioplastics input (Zeller et al., 2013), to bio-asphalt (Audo et al., 2015), tohigh-protein ""superfood"" (Hug and Von Der Weid, 2011; www.cyanotech.com; www.earthrise.com), to biofuel (Brennan and Owende, 2010; Lundquist et al., 2010; Benemann, 2013; E4Tech, 2014), to high-value nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals (Fichtali andSenanayake, 2010; Cuellar-Bermudez et al., 2014; Stefan and Boussiba, 2014).  CO.sub.2 typically is diffused by bubbling in photobioreactors or into downflow bubble-diffuser trenches in circulating open pond systems of the Oswald type (Oswald, 1962,1988; Richmond and Hu, 2013; Weissman and Goebel, 1987).  Alternately, for pH above .about.10, CO.sub.2 input can be coupled with a cyclic pH-swing process.  This process absorbs CO.sub.2 by converting dissolved sodium carbonate into dissolved sodiumbicarbonate.  This is operated in a diurnal cycle that balances the pH decrease of CO.sub.2 addition at night with the opposite process of pH increase driven by algal photosynthesis during the day (Chi et al., 2011, 2013).', 'Algal biomass processing can utilize CO.sub.2 in various ways.  Lee et al., (2015) have demonstrated a method for pressurized CO.sub.2 to be used as a coagulation agent for algal harvesting.  Supercritical and other forms of CO.sub.2 can be usedfor product extractions from algal biomass (for example: Aresta et al., 2005; Soh and Zimmerman, 2011, 2012; Soh et al., 2014; Du et al., 2015; Goto et al., 2015).  Of particular interest, low-energy-cost CO.sub.2 switchable solvent systems have beenproposed by Boyd et al., (2012) and Du et al., (2013, 2015) for lipids extraction from wet algal biomass.', 'CO.sub.2 can be utilized industrially as a thermal energy transport fluid for efficient geothermal energy extraction.  Low viscosity and a strong thermosiphon convective plume effect are the key physical advantages.

The method utilizes natural deposits of sodium carbonate (Na.sub.2CO.sub.3, ""soda ash""), natron(Na.sub.2CO.sub.3.10H.sub.2O), trona (Na.sub.2CO.sub.3.2H.sub.2O.NaHCO.sub.3), and also natural alkali brines (Wikipedia: ""Sodium Bicarbonate""; Church & Dwight, website; Howe, 1928; Mineral Information Service, 1959; Garrett, 1995; Kostick, 1992, 1998;Cho et al., 2008).  Deposits of soda ash, natron, trona, and associated alkali brines, are found on a very large scale in the state of Wyoming in the USA, and also in Turkey, China, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania.  Carbonation withCO.sub.2 and water to produce sodium bicarbonate follows the exothermic low-temperature chemical reaction: Na.sub.2CO.sub.3+H.sub.2O+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.2NaHCO.sub.3, (with precipitate composition control dependent upon temperature and CO.sub.2concentration.  Eugster, 1966; Lowenstain and Demicco, 2006).  Industrializations of this process utilizing the minerals noted above, and alkali brines, are extensive.  Industrial processes have been widely patented beginning at least by 1911 (Wrinkleand Paddock, 1911: U.S.  Pat.  No. 1,000,138, ""Method of obtaining bicarbonate of soda"").  Substantial recent focus has been on the use of the Na-carbonate system in the capture of CO.sub.2 in flue gases.  Technology developments for CO.sub.2 captureinclude sodium bicarbonate production (Huttenhuis et al., 2015) as well as cyclical processes of CO.sub.2 capture and purification from powerplant flue gases via carbonation-hydration of sodium carbonate to produce sodium bicarbonate as a CO.sub.2capture process.  This is followed by a regeneration step of decarbonation-dehydration back to sodium carbonate, yielding purified CO.sub.2 (Liang, 2003; Liang et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2009; Ficicilar and Dogu, 2006; Knuutila et al., 2009, 2010a,b;Spigarelli and Kawatra, 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Stolaroff and Bourcier, 2014).', 'High pH alkaline brines (rich in sodium carbonate) are strong CO.sub.2 absorbers from the atmosphere.  They exhibit very high productivity for algal biomass growth of the ""soda lake"" type.  CO.sub.2 absorption lowers the pH of the brine, whereasphotosynthesis raises it.  This is the consequence of a pH-dependent transformation of the ion balance.  There are two Na.sup.+ cations per CO.sub.3.sup.2- anion at higher pH, whereas Na.sup.+ cations are balanced by one HCO.sub.3.sup.- anion each atlower pH.  Photosynthetic growth of algal biomass transforms carbon from bicarbonate anions into organic matter, causing an increase in pH.  This is because algal cells capturing HCO.sub.3.sup.- anions as a CO.sub.2 source regulate pH by importingH.sup.+.  They do so in response to the H.sup.+-consuming (and thereby OH.sup.--producing) equilibrium governing photosynthetic utilization of the bicarbonate ion as a carbon source: H.sup.++HCO.sub.3.sup.-.revreaction.CO.sub.2+H.sub.2O.  Asphotosynthesis consumes CO.sub.2 and boosts the pH in the medium cells inhabit, lake surface CO.sub.2 absorption increases transporting more CO.sub.2 into solution.  Alkaline brines therefore function as CO.sub.2 pumps in two different modes.  These are:(i) first, as noted above, by inorganic ""mineralization"" pumping CO.sub.2 into sodium bicarbonate precipitates (requiring continued input of both CO.sub.2 and sodium carbonate), and (ii) second by photosynthetic pumping of the carbon in CO.sub.2 intobiomass.', 'Shulin Chen\'s research group at Washington State University (Chi et al., 2011, 2013, 2014) has shown how CO.sub.2 utilization can employ these aspects of carbonate chemistry.  The process is a ""pH swing"" cycle.  CO.sub.2 is absorbed into high pHsodium carbonate-rich solutions at night.  This decreases pH to create bicarbonate ion dominance.  Algal photosynthesis during the day absorbs this CO.sub.2 (via bicarbonate), increasing pH.  Photosynthetic production of biomass thereby transforms theremaining Na.sup.+-balanced bicarbonate anions (HCO.sub.3.sup.-) in solution into a population of carbonate anions (CO.sub.3.sup.2-), each of which is charge-balanced by two sodium cations.  Hence, combining carbonate chemistry for CO.sub.2 absorption atnight with aqueous photobiology for its uptake during the day, allows carbonate-rich bioculture solutions, inorganically to absorb, and photobiologically to fix CO.sub.2 in a diurnal day-night cycle.  Additional utility from CO.sub.2 capture into acarbonate system follows from the ability of a high-pH sodium carbonate solution to be used to absorb and transport algal-bioavailable CO.sub.2 in the form of bicarbonate anion in solution.  This capacity can avoid gas compression by transportation ofbicarbonate in situations where sources and sinks are separated only by a few kilometers (Chi et al., 2011).  (See also: Guangmin et al., 2014).', ""Carbon dioxide is a thermodynamic end state for energy release in processes of hydrocarbon combustion.  Lower energy states exist, however, when considered relative to mineralized states of carbon as carbonates.  This is why most of the carbonin the Earth's crust-hydrosphere-atmosphere system is present in the crust in the form of carbonate rocks and minerals rather than as CO.sub.2 elsewhere.  Therefore, carbon dioxide can be utilized as a heat-releasing fuel via mineral weathering. CO.sub.2, however, is not a fuel that allows trivially practical access to the energy it carries.  Yet, very substantial energy is released in endothermic chemical transformations of CO.sub.2 reacting with minerals such as olivine to produce hydrated andnon-hydrated carbonate minerals (Schuiling, 2013).  Olivine weathering also can produce hydrogen gas and reduce CO.sub.2 into methane ethane and propane by a process of serpentinization (Akinfiev et al., 2005; Neubeck et al., 2011; Schrenk et al., 2013). CO.sub.2 energy release technologies based on the weathering of olivine and related minerals and rocks have not yet been commercialized.  The Dutch company Innovation Concepts, BV (www.innovationconcepts.eu) is focused on this task.  Energy release fromolivine carbonation may be important in the future in contexts relating to the industrial utilization of olivine combined with agendas for very large scale carbon sequestration."", 'Carbon dioxide can be utilized in large quantities via new forms of ore processing.  Supercritical CO.sub.2 can be used for low-energy extraction of lithium (Li) from lithium-bearing pegmatite minerals such as spudomene, petalite, zinnwaldite,amblygonite, lepidolite and triphylite.  Lithium is in high and rapidly growing demand globally due to its use in Li-ion batteries.  Typically lithium is sold from the mining sector in the chemical form of lithium carbonate: Li.sub.2CO.sub.3.  A newmethod for lithium ore processing by CO.sub.2 to extract lithium is described in a patent granted to Pedro Mauel Brito da Silva Correia (2015, U.S.  Pat.  No. 9,028,789 B2: ""Process to produce lithium carbonate directly from aluminosilicate mineral""). This method requires inputs of CO.sub.2, water and sodium bicarbonate.  It uses high pressure and modest heating in the range 200 to 600 C. It operates without requiring acids.  It therefore does not generate acidic processing waste.  Related methodsutilizing CO.sub.2 are described in a patent application by the Finnish company Outec: US 2015/0044124 A1: Marika Tilhonen and Liisa Haavanlammi, ""Method for recovering lithium carbonate,"" and in presentations by Nogueira (2011) and Margarido et al.,(2014), described as ""carbonate pressure leaching.""', 'A second ore processing method utilizing CO.sub.2 is focused on dissolving the mineral olivine [(Mg,Fe, +minor Ni).sub.2SiO.sub.4].  It uses a chemical process of ""carbon mineralization"" (Power et al., 2013).  This mimics natural weathering. [Forsterite weathering: MgSiO.sub.4+4CO.sub.2+4H.sub.2O.fwdarw.2Mg.sup.2++4HCO.sub.3.sup.-+H.sub.- 4SiO.sub.4.sup.0].  The method hugely accelerates the reaction rate without use of acids or high-temperature processing.  The main element of the processis high-pressure processing of finely ground olivine in supercritical CO.sub.2 and water with NaHCO.sub.3 additive.  It has been shown to dissolve finely ground olivine by more than 70% within two hours (Eikland et al., 2015; Gadikota et al., 2014;Gerdemann et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2006; O\'Connor et al., 2005; for an overview see: Sanna et al., 2014, and Kelemen et al., 2011).  Additional insights on optimizing olivine dissolution utilizing CO.sub.2 and various additives have been published bythe ETH-Swiss group of Marco Mazzotti and colleagues (Prigiobbe et al. 2009a,b, 2013a,b; Mazzotti, 2011; Prigiobbe and Mazotti, 2011).  Olivine CO.sub.2-dissolution processes yield mostly magnesium carbonates along with extractable forms of nickel,silicic acid (H.sub.4SiO.sub.4) and/or nano-silica (SiO.sub.2), and oxidized forms of iron.  Methods have been developed for the purpose of fixation of waste CO.sub.2 by mineral carbonation.  However, such methods likely can allow extractiveindustrialization of byproducts, for example metals production for iron, nickel, and possibly also magnesium.  An example is the byproducts monetization agenda being developed by the mining company Orica in Australia.  This is for very large scalecarbonation of serpentinite for CO.sub.2 sequestration (Brent et al., 2011; Brent, 2013, 2014; see also Ramao et al., 2015).  Nickel production is a possibility.  Large-scale production of nickel via olivine carbonation with CO.sub.2 has been proposed bySantos et al., (2015).  It also was considered by Thorliefson (2011) for the Duluth Complex in the state of Minnesota in the USA.  Huge untapped dunite reserves exist in many world locations.  Development of an olivine carbonation method of nickel (andiron and nano-silicon) production offers huge potential for very large scale CO.sub.2 utilization.  World nickel demand is .about.2 million tonnes per annum (MTA).  It is growing at about 10% per year (Pinizzotto, 2015).  Nickel contents in olivineobtained from the olivine-dominated rock type dunite often are .about.0.3% Ni by weight.  For comparison, a good quality of viable lateritic nickel ore is .about.2% Ni.  Some world class nickel ore deposits are well below 1% Ni (see: page 11 diagram inEmery et al., undated).  For example, Australia\'s largest nickel-producing mine, Mount Keith, has an ore grade of 0.5% nickel (Wilson et al., 2014).  If half of the present scale of world nickel demand (at .about.2 MTA Ni) were to be satisfied viaolivine carbonation processing, with Ni at .about.0.3 weight percent and a CO.sub.2/olivine mass ratio corresponding to 4CO.sub.2/MgSiO.sub.4, then the scale of associated CO.sub.2 utilization-sequestration into Mg carbonates would be .about.500 MTA ofCO.sub.2 capture-mineralization.  (CO.sub.2 utilization-sequestration in this process is .about.500.times.Ni production, by weight, for a 0.3% Ni ore grade.) This is roughly 1.5% of total present day world anthropogenic CO.sub.2 emissions.  For nickel atUS$10,000/tonne, a CO.sub.2 utilization subsidy of US$20/tonne CO.sub.2 for carbon sequestration would add $10,000/tonne to Ni sales (or neutralize a $20/tonne cost for obtaining usable CO.sub.2).  Iron often exceeds 10% by weight in olivine.  Therefore,associated iron production could exceed 30.times.  nickel at 30 MTA.  Carbonation of ground olivine obtained from dunite bodies has been widely discussed as a potentially realistic means of very large scale carbon sequestration (Voormeij and Simandi,2004; Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006; Teir et al., 2010; Kohler et al., 2010, 2013; Schuiling et al., 2011; Schuiling and de Boer, 2011, 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013; Schuiling, 2014; Smartstones, 2014).  The Mount Keith nickel mine in SW Australia is oneof the world\'s largest reserves of Ni ore.  It has a minerology of predominantly methamorphosed dunite (olivine).  It has been strategized as having the capability to become the world\'s largest CO.sub.2 sequestration operation at 4 MTA CO.sub.2 bycarbonation of mine tailings (Wilson et al., 2014: Power et al., 2014).  Developing nickel mining via carboration processing of olivine would integrate Ni-production directly with CO.sub.2 fixation, with co-production of iron, silicon and Mg-carbonatesproducts.  Realism for large-scale operations likely would require a profit-based situation where the value of a primary target product, such as nickel, exceeds production cost (Priestnall, 2014; Santos, 2014).  The use of CO.sub.2 in nickel oreprocessing is known.  A CO.sub.2 processing step is presented in the 1973 patent disclosure of Y. Sato et al., of the Nippon Yakin Kogyo Company: U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,765,873, ""Method of producing ferro-nickel or metallic nickel."" And a new process forlaterite nickel ore processing with inclusion of CO.sub.2-carbonation for magnesium separation has been described by Zhai et al., (2010).  A positive factor for olivine carbonation on a large-scale, as noted above, is that the reaction is exothermic(Schuiling, 2013).  Breakdown products of olivine carbonation can be useful as plant fertilizer (Berge et al., 2012; www.greensand.nl), especially in conditions of silicon, iron and magnesium demand, with nickel removed.  Silicic acid fertilization canbe of particular importance for the productivity of rice and banana (Guntzer et al., 2012; Fortunato et al., 2012; Kablan et al., 2012; Meena et al., 2014).  CO.sub.2-dissolution of olivine also can be an effective way to create nutrient Si- and Fe-richnutrient water for the production of algal products from biocultures of algal diatoms (Schuiling, 2012, 2014).', 'Olivine carbonation utilizing CO.sub.2 can be arranged to produce nano-silica.  Nano-silica is useful as a pozzolanic cement strengthening additive in Portland cement (Lazaro et al., 2012, 2013; Gupta, 2013, 2014; Maheswaran et al., 2013; Singhet al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014; Quercia Bianci and Brouwers, 2015).  Adding nano-silica additive into cement in modest amounts can add 40% to compressive strength to concrete made with it.  It also accelerates hydration-setting, decreases porosity andCa-leaching, and increases durability (Sing et al., 2013).  Nano-silica transforms ordinary concrete into a high-performance concrete, allowing a higher aggregate-to-cement volume ratio and associated cost savings.', 'An additional use for CO.sub.2 is via processes for alumina production from aluminosilicate ores as alternatives to the traditional alumina sources of bauxite.  Aluminosilicate ores include nepheline (Na.sub.3KAl.sub.4Si.sub.4O.sub.16)-richnephelinite, typically in the form of igneous nephelene syenite rock, and also separated aluminum feldspars (KAlSi.sub.3O.sub.8--NaAlSi.sub.3O.sub.8--CaAl.sub.2Si.sub.2O.s- ub.8) such as the very common granitic mineral orthoclase (KAlSi.sub.3O.sub.8). Orthoclase can be processed to produce a potassium fertilizer co-product.  Anorthite (CaAl.sub.2Si.sub.2O.sub.8) can be processed to produce calcium carbonate as a co-product to alumina.  Anorthite often is present in high purity in massive igneouscumulate complexes known as ""anorthosite"" massifs.  Archibald filed a patent in 1942 for the Canadian company Nephiline Products Limited.  His method utilizes the mineral nephiline to produce alumina.  It involves limestone addition and carbonizationsteps with CO.sub.2: U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,420,852, ""Recovery of alumina from ores."" A similar method has long been used in alumina production from nephelinite ores in the Soviet Union/Russia (Smirnov, 1996; Volsky, 21012).  A recent publication describing asimilar technique is Qui et al., (2015).  A more recent process focused on anorthosite ore has been developed by the Norwegian company Nordic Mining (Nordic Mining, undated, 2011; Fossum, 2014; Aranda and Mastin: Norwegian patent granted in 2015: number20140317, ""En ny fremgangsmate for fremstilling av alumina og karbonat fra aluminiumrike materialer med integerert CO.sub.2 utnyttelse""; also: WO 2015137823 A1, ""Alumina and carbonate production method from al-rich materials with integrated CO.sub.2utilization."").  The method obtains separated alumina, precipitated calcium carbonate and precipitated silica from HCl-leached aluminum-rich silicate minerals, particularly from anorthite from anorthosite ore.  Carbon dioxide is used to separate calciumfrom aluminum chloride by precipitation of CaCO.sub.3 from HCl acid solution of the mineral concentrate.  A method for liberating potassium from potassium feldspar (orthoclase) with CO.sub.2 carbonation has been described by Xie et al., (2013, 2015). The method dissolves orthoclase hydrothermally in the presence of CO.sub.2 with added calcium chloride and triethanolamine.  Variant methods have been described by Ye et al., (2014) and Wang et al., (2014).  Future developments in this arena perhaps maybe able to obtain separated alumina, silica, calcium carbonate, and potassium salts.  The most interesting strategic possibility will be in the potential use of supercritical solutions of CO.sub.2 plus water and reaction-accelerating substances todissolve anorthite and/or K-feldspar efficiently at modest temperatures.', 'The ""weathering"" reaction of CO.sub.2 with silicate minerals mostly is exothermic.  Therefore mineral carbonation is a thermodynamically favored modality for CO.sub.2 utilization and sequestration.  However reaction kinetics often are very slow. Therefore accelerating mineral dissolution with low-energy, low-cost and low-waste methods is an important technology development challenge.  Kakizawa et al., (2001), Tier at al., (2007), Ghoorah (2014), Ghoorah et al., (2014a,b), and Dlugogorski et al.,in a patent application (US 2014/0065039, ""Extraction of alkali metals and/or alkaline earth metals for use in carbon sequestration"") have shown that weak solutions of acetic or formic acid can very strongly accelerate silicate mineral weathering undervarious conditions.', 'Titanium separation is an additional potential use for CO.sub.2 in ore processing.  The mineral ilmentite (FeTiO.sub.3) is often used as a titanium ore.  Carbochlorination treatment with chlorine gas and carbon monoxide produces separable Ti inthe form of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl.sub.4).  Titanium is separated from iron by a wide variety of additional thermochemical methods in ilmenite processing.  All are multi-stage and energy intensive (Zhang et al., 2011) with the exception of recentdevelopments of low-temperature chlorination methods using carbon tetrachloride, CCl.sub.4, sometimes in combination with Cl.sub.2 (Fu et al., 2009; Norazharuddin et al., 2015), thereby combining chlorination with reduction.  Tolley and Tester (1989),Tolley et al., (1992), and Tolly and Whitehead in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,853,205, ""Supercritical fluid halide separation process,"" all have shown that TiCl.sub.4 is soluble at low temperature in supercritical CO.sub.2.  This insight combined with the newCCl.sub.4-based chlorination process likely can allow an efficient separation of titanium from ilmenite in a ""green chemistry"" treatment process utilizing CO.sub.2.', 'Tantalum- and niobium-rich ""coltan"" ores can be processed using carbon tetrachloride or silicon tetrachloride liquids reacting with ores to chlorinate niobium and tantalum at relatively low temperatures (Shainyan et al., 2008).  Green chemistryadvocate James Clark of the University of York has called for the development of a broadly similar green process for tantalum separation from coltan ores (York, 2014).  An industrial niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) separation processing method for coltanores possibly could be developed utilizing tetrachlorides followed either by evaporation or by supercritical CO.sub.2 liquid-liquid extraction to obtain separated Nb- and Ta-pentaclorides.  A patent application for the use of carbon tetrachloride is:Terakhov et al., WO2015039219 A1, ""Process for recovering tantalum and niobium with carbon tetrachloride.""', 'Rare Earth Elements (REE) are an important strategic resource with rapidly increasing demand globally (McLellan et al., 2013).  A fascinating proposal put forward by Arab et al., (2104, 2015) is to mine REEs by an extraction method ofpercolative leaching.  Percolative leaching uses CO.sub.2 injected into a REE-carrying ore zone at depth sufficient for CO.sub.2 to be in a supercritical state.  If realized, this mode of mining would involve either multiple drill holes, some forinjection and some for collection, or alternately a single-hole flow reversing system with injection followed by collection.  Use of horizontal drilling and fracture-generating injection technologies (""fracking"") can be imagined.  If developed, thisproposed technology could provide a revolutionary mode for REE mining.  Other elements potentially leachable by this CO.sub.2-based method include gold (Glennon et al., 1999, 2003; Glennon, 2003; van Zyl, 2007) and uranium (Wang et al., 2013). Carbonatites and solidified magma bodies and plutons associated with highly alkaline volcanic provinces are an obvious target geology for testing this technology as a consequence of their typical REE enrichment (Verplanck and Van Gosen, 2011).', 'Magnesite (MgCO.sub.3) ores can be purified by leaching and re-precipitation using pressurized CO.sub.2, as demonstrated by Amer, (2010).  Magnesite obtained from olivine dissolution-carbonation can be used as an additive in concrete production. It also can be decarbonated (with CO.sub.2 recycling, if desired) to create magnesium oxide for use in cement production and also for producing ""MgO board."" MgO board (e.g., http://magobp.com) is a superior form of interior wall-building ""wallboard""material.  Its use is directly analogous to the (gypsum-based) ""drywall"" wallboard used very widely in construction.  MgO board, however, possesses superior surface hardness, fire-resistance, mold-resistance, and installation workability relative toconventional drywall (Thomas, 2007; http://magobp.com/benefits/; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_oxide_wallboard).  It is widely manufactured and used in China.  The main cementitious process in its manufacture is based on the hydration ofreactive MgO to micro-brucite, Mg(OH).sub.2.  CO.sub.2 utilization via carbonation-hydration in producing MgO board in a CO.sub.2-rich atmosphere is possible, but not yet commercialized.  Also, wallboard can be made with direct incorporation of magnesiumcarbonates, as disclosed in a 1933 patent: U.S.  Pat.  No. 1,896,689, Spenser, ""Building Material and Method of Making the Same.""', 'CO.sub.2 utilization on a very large scale is possible by mass production of new types of cement and concrete, which structurally incorporate CO.sub.2.  This innovation has substantial environmental significance because Portland cementmanufacture is responsible for .about.9% of world total anthropogenic CO.sub.2 emissions.  The new mode of cement production is a consequence of the possibility to use magnesium (Mg) as a full or partial replacement for calcium (Ca), (Harrison, 2003,2004, 2006, 2013, 2014, 2015a,b; Al-Tabbaa, 2013; Imbabi et al., 2012; Glasser et al., 2016; Evans, 2008, 2009, 2010; Evans and Vlasopoulos, 2010).  The technology for the production of CO.sub.2-utilizing Mg-based ""eco-cements"" and ""eco-concretes"" hasbeen described and demonstrated by several institutions worldwide.  These include, most notably: TecEco (www.tececo.com), a business created by the Australian inventor-entrepreneur John W. Harrison (Harrison, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2013, 2014, 2015a,b andU.S.  Pat.  No. 7,347,896 B2: ""Reactive Magnesium Oxide Cements""), and the Cambridge University research group of Professor Abir Al-Tabbaa, in connection with the Cambridge-based David Ball Group plc (http://www.davidballgroup.co.uk; WO2013178967 A1:Martin et al., ""Cementitious binders, activators and methods for making concrete."") via a former PhD student Martin Liska (Vandeperre and Al-Tabbaa, 2007; Liska et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Liska and Al-Tabbaa, 2008, 2009, 2012; Unluer and Al-Tabbaa, 2013,2014, 2015a,b; Unluer, 2015).  CO.sub.2-incorporating Mg-based cements can be produced by at least three different modes to generate a cementitious matrix.  One is to produce the dry cement mix containing reactive MgO (periclase) and/or magnesiumhydroxide, Mg(OH).sub.2 (brucite), then hydrate and carbonate the cement during setting to form a range of cementitious magnesium carbonate hydrates.  At the present level of technology, this requires setting within a thermally-controlled pressurechamber providing CO.sub.2 and steam (Unluer, 2015).  Cementitious hydrated Mg-carbonates include: nesquahonite [MgCO.sub.3.3H.sub.2O], landsfordite [MgCO.sub.3.5H.sub.2O], hydromagnesite [4MgCO.sub.3.Mg(OH).sub.2.4H.sub.2O], and dypingite[4MgCO.sub.3.Mg(OH).sub.2.5H.sub.2O].  Another mode is to produce the dry cement mix with Mg present in the already carbonated form of the anhydrous Mg-carbonate magnesite (MgCO.sub.3), then to hydrate-transform-recrystallize it into hydrated carbonatephases during setting (Glasser et al., 2015).  This method requires setting with thermal control, therefore within temperature-controlled premises.  For optimality, it may require pressurized gas environment control also.  This mode sequesters CO.sub.2if the input magnesite been produced by carbonation of brucite.  The third type of CO.sub.2-utilizing Mg-based cement and concrete can be produced beginning directly with hydrated Mg-carbonates in the dry cement formulation prior to use.  In such cases,cementitious transformations are obtainable by cycling changes in temperature with or without hydration, and/or CO.sub.2, and/or steam injection, in order to control transformation and recrystallization conditions, for example from nesquahonite torecrystallized nesquahonite via a thermal cycle exceeding nesquahonite\'s stability range.  This mode may be possible for conventional pouring without need for a pressure chamber, requiring only the ability to heat-up the mixed concrete prior to pouring(Glasser et al., 2016).  Such a mode sequesters CO.sub.2 if the input phases have been produced by carbonation-hydration of brucite.  Overall, a great many types of situations are possible via variable input chemistries, mixtures with conventionalPortland cement, pozzolanic matrix additions, pozzolanic aggregate additions, CO.sub.2 and/or steam input carbonation, and preparation, pouring and curing techniques.  Production methods may range from casting and setting blocks and reinforced sectionwithin confined vessels under pressurized CO.sub.2 with or without steam, to pouring and setting in the field like ordinary concretes made with Portland cement.  The field of creating and industrializing Mg-based CO.sub.2-utilizing cement and concretetechnologies has a big future.  However, it has only begun to be demonstrated in research labs and in a few pioneering industrial applications.  Some of the demonstrated building materials exhibit superior properties of strength in comparison toconventional Portland cement.  However, CO.sub.2-utilizing Mg-based cements involving hydrated Mg-carbonates require careful formulation and preparation as well as use limitations to low temperatures (<.about.50 degrees C., Morgan et al., 2015).  Thelatter is especially important due to thermal instabilities in the hydrated Mg-carbonates comprising the cementitious matrix, particularly nesquahonite.  Nesquahonite has an excellent property in that it in cements it forms in strongly cementitiouscrystal whisker networks.  However, it has a poor thermal stability range limiting for practical purposes to less than .about.50 degrees centigrade (Walling and Provis, 2015; Unluer and Al-Tabbaa, 2015b; Highfield et al., 2013).', 'Carbonated Mg-based cements are different from Mg-based phosphatic cements such as Sorel cement (Shand, 2016).  They also differ from non-carbonated MgO-based cements produced from magnesite or Mg-rich dolomite or dolomitic limestone inputswhich are kiln-fired to drive-off CO.sub.2 to produce reactive MgO.  (That is: prepared from MgCO.sub.3 in direct analogy to Portland cement using CaO obtained by decarbonation of CaCO.sub.3 limestone, then cured by various hydration reactions.) Suchreactive MgO-based cements are well-known for high performance.  In New York State, the high performance of historic ""Rosendale"" cements and concretes is due to high magnesium in the limestone used to make it (TecEco, undated).  Kiln-firing ""calcination""of high Mg limestone generates MgO and Mg-carbonates in addition to the usual CaO content which is the main input into the formula of Portland cement.  MgO-based concretes have been used extensively in China in dam construction.  Their volume stabilityduring curing is especially prized.  See: Zheng et al., 1991; Du, 2005; Premier, undated; Mo et al., 2014).', ""By contrast, CO.sub.2-utilizing Mg-based cements do not begin with a CO.sub.2 releasing decarbonation step to prepare reactive MgO.  The basic difference with respect to the calcium system is two-fold.  First, both MgO and Mg(OH).sub.2 can beobtained without using natural MgCO.sub.3 (magnesite) as a natural starting material, whereas CaO (burnt lime) and Ca(OH).sub.2 (calcium hydroxide Portlandite) are very rare in the Earth's crust.  They typically are obtained by high-temperaturekiln-firing of limestone: CaCO.sub.3.fwdarw.CaO+CO.sub.2.  By contrast, magnesium hydroxide (brucite) can be obtained from natural deposits or by precipitation from either seawater or alkaline freshwaters and brines obtained from lakes or wells.  Brucitethen can be heated above 500 C to dehydrate it into reactive MgO (Shand, 2006; Alvarado et al., 2000).  Second, CO.sub.2-utilizing cements are based on a cementitious carbonate-hydrate mineralogy, whereas the setting of Portland cement predominantly isbased on hydration mineralogy."", 'In U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1, the present inventor disclosed a method and system that included a process of obtaining precipitate comprised predominantly of magnesium hydroxide in large quantities from Lake Kivu. The obtaining of this flux of precipitate was from a process of water treatment of return flow water following extractive degassing of an upflow of deepwater.', 'CO.sub.2 also is utilized for carbonation of ordinary Portland cement in the solidification of pre-cast building materials.  Two companies, Solidia Technologies (Riman, 2012; Sadu and Cristofaro, 2013; DeCristofaro and Sahu, 2014, 2015a,b;DeCristofaro et al., 2014; DeCristofaro, 2015; Jain et al., 2013, 2014, 2015), in partnership with LaFarge (Lafarge, 2015), and CarbonCure Technologies (www.carboncure.com; Monkman and Shao, 2010; Monkman, 2012; Monkman and Niven, 2010; Divon, 2015),have industrialized such processes for manufacturing pressed masonry blocks (known in the USA as ""cinder blocks"").  These companies variously carbonate and hydrate mold-injected masonry blocks in the processes of injection and curing.', 'Pressure carbonation with supercritical CO.sub.2 has been well-demonstrated to enhance the strength and durability of a variety of composite objects molded with Portland cements and concretes (Rubin et al., 2003; Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2007,2008; Knopf et al., 1999; Fernandez Bertos et al., 2004; Farahi et al., 2007, 2013; Farahi, 2009).  This technique was developed at Los Alamos National Lab in the 1990s (Rubin et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1997).  It led to a patent and a companyproducing products such as roofing tiles under the trade name ""supramics"" (Jones, 2001; Jones, 1996: U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,518,540: ""Cement treated with high-pressure CO.sub.2."").  High-strength carbonated cement-bonded particleboard incorporating woodybiomass is, for example, produced by rapid exposure to supercritical CO.sub.2 (Suh et al., 2000; Hermawan et al., 2000, 2001; Maail et al., 2011).  This method includes cement-bonded particleboard made with oil palm frond waste material (Hermawan et al.,2002).  The method, however, has never taken off industrially.  The obvious reason is that facilities for high-pressure carbonation treatment of molded building materials with supercritical CO.sub.2 are rare and expensive, and also because CO.sub.2typically obtained for such uses is costly.  However, such reasons are not fundamental impediments that apply to all circumstances.', 'High-value medical products for human implantation can be made with technologies developed for making molded composite materials incorporating carbonates formed by interactions with supercritical CO.sub.2 (e.g., Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2015).', 'Pressurized CO.sub.2 is used in the production of the remarkable, newly discovered, magnesium carbonate material ""Upsalite.RTM."" (Wikipedia: Upsalite; Forsgren et al., 2013; Frykstrand et al., 2014; TCE News, 2013; Yousefi, undated).  Upsaliteis an anhydrous micro- and macroporous form of magnesium carbonate, MgCO.sub.3.  It possesses an astonishingly large surface area of .about.800 square meters per gram.  Upsalite is a powerfully hygroscopic desiccant, functioning effectively at lowhumidity.  It also has been shown to be effective as a biologically harmless, space-efficient, absorbant binding material for time-extended diffusional drug release in pharmaceutical tablets.  (Zhang et al., 2016; Frykstrand et al., 2015).  The Swedishcompany Disruptive Materials (www.disruptivematerials.com) has been created to pursue market development for Upsalite.RTM..', 'The input and degassing of CO.sub.2 into and out of aqueous solutions can be utilized for pH control and precipitation control.  Decrease in pH is achieved by acidifying addition of CO.sub.2 into solution, such as by sparging.  The pH of anaqueous solution containing CO.sub.2 and/or bicarbonate and/or carbonate anions can increased by removal of CO.sub.2 from solution by equilibration with gas and by bubbling aeration, stirring, sparging with CO.sub.2-free gases (e.g., N.sub.2) and byvacuum degassing.  For an example of CO.sub.2 acidification, Ferreira et al, (2012) used CO.sub.2 input to decrease and thereby stabilize the pH of an aqueous bioculture of spirulina algae housed in a recirculating photobioreactor.  The increase of pHdriven by photosynthetic activity of the algae was thereby balanced by CO.sub.2 input acidification which also feeds the algae as a carbon source via bicarbonate ion.  For an example of the opposite process, degassing CO.sub.2 to increase pH, Cohen andKirchmann, (2004) reported degassing of wastewater samples wherein use of atmospheric air as the stripping gas increased pH from a start at pH 8.3 to an equilibrium pH of 8.5, whereas using pure N.sub.2 instead of air increased the endpoint pH to 10.3. This method was developed to allow precipitation of wastewater phosphorus as struvite to realize P-recycling (Cohen, 2001; see also: Fatteh et al., 2008a,b, 2010; Radev et al., 2015).  Oliver et al., (2014) reported similar findings of pH increase toprecipitate nesquahonite by CO.sub.2 removal from a solution of magnesium carbonate by gas stripping with N.sub.2.  These authors reported additional results for CO.sub.2 removal by algal biological CO.sub.2 uptake, and by accelerated conversion ofbicarbonate to aqueous CO.sub.2 by addition of carbonic anhydrase.  Nitrogen sparging to remove fermentation-CO.sub.2 from (acidic) pickle brining operations is reviewed by Fleming (1979).  Lisitsin at al., (2008) have shown that CO.sub.2 stripping canprecipitate calcium and magnesium from desalination feed waters as a method of water softening pretreatment replacing the use of chemical alkali addition.  Israeli Technion scientists have further demonstrated methods based on CO.sub.2 stripping toprecipitate calcium from brackish waters prior to reverse osmosis membrane desalination (Hasson et al., 2011; Segev et al., 2011, 2013).  Geroni et al., (2012) have demonstrated an analogous CO.sub.2-stripping method for removing dissolved iron andassociated metals from mine water.  CO.sub.2 degassing to increase the pH of river water samples containing calcium and magnesium in solution is used as a method to determine potential precipitative scaling of these elements in industrial water-coolingapplications (Gauthier et al., 2012; Chao et al., 2014; Hamdi and Tlili, 2016).  Circulating geothermal fluids rich in Mg, Ca and CO.sub.2 will precipitate Mg and Ca out of solution under surface conditions with CO.sub.2 degassing and consequent pHincrease, as in the case of natural travertine deposition (Pentacost, 2005; Rodrigo-Naharro et al., 2013) and scale deposit clogging of pipes in geothermal energy operations (Wasch, 2014).  Also, Spilling et al., (2010) demonstrated micro-precipitationof calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide onto diatoms in a photosynthetic algal bioculture by the simple process of discontinuing the CO.sub.2 supply such that pH was increased by photosynthetic CO.sub.2 removal from solution.  This process is knownas algal autoflocculation (Sukenik and Shelef, 1984).  The Controlled Hydrodynamic Cavitation (CHC) method of Ecowater Systems provides an additional example (Ecowater Systems, undated).  The German company Budenheim (www.budenheim.com) developed anindustrial method for phosphorus recovery from waste streams that uses CO.sub.2 for pH control in both directions via a ""pH swing"" method: the Budenheim Carbonic Acid Process (Stossel, 2013; Ewart et al., 2014; Wollman and Moller, 2015).  This methodremoves phosphorus from sewage sludge first by injection of CO.sub.2 at high pressure to solubilize organic P into dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in an acidic liquid phase for a liquid/solid separation step.  A CO.sub.2 vacuum degassing stepfollows.  This precipitates P from the separated solution under high-pH conditions.  To decrease pH, CO.sub.2 pressure can be applied by sparging into and/or by providing CO.sub.2 gas pressure over a solution.  This can be done to keep magnesium and/orcalcium in solution in conditions where pH is low enough to prevent precipitative saturation conditions from being reached.  Such procedures are common in ""recarbonation"" steps following the lime-soda ash process for water softening (Butler, 1982; Wanget al., 2004; Messer, 2013).  Thus CO.sub.2-based pH modification can provide control over mineral precipitation, particularly magnesium hydroxide, and various magnesium and calcium carbonates.  The systematics of aqueous carbonate chemistry arepresented in Butler (1982, 1989), Emerson, (1975), Stumm and Morgan, (3 editions: 1970, 1981, 1996), Langmuir, (1997), Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, (2001), Bustos-Serrano, (2010), Talling, (2010), Millero, (2013), Munhoven (2013a,b), and Orr et al., (2015). Various computational models exist.  These include PHREEQC (http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/; www.hydrochemistry.eu; de Moel et al., 2015) and The Geochemists Workbench (www.gwb.com; Bethke, 2008).  A detailed understanding ofCO.sub.2 degassing and consequent pH increase and precipitation has been obtained from the study of cave waters and speleothems (e.g., Holland et al., 1964; Dreybrodt, 1980, 2013; Hansen et al., 2013).  A 1-page summary overview is provided by Railsback,(2006).  Detailed systematics for CO.sub.2 degassing from large scale water flows and in relation to carbonate water chemistry have been developed for application in aquaculture operations, particularly recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), (Grace andPiedrahita, 1993, 1994; Summerfelt et al., 2000, 2003, 2015; Moran 2010a,b; Timmons et al., 2001, 2002; Timmons and Ebeling, 2007, 2010, 2013).  The degassibility of CO.sub.2 from alkaline solutions differs greatly as a function of pH (Hardy et al.,2007; Willauer et al., 2008, 2009a,b, 2010a,b, 2011, 2012a,b, 2014; DiMascio et al., 2010; Eisaman et al., 2012).  High pH carbonate waters do not contain appreciable dissolved CO.sub.2 in solution.  They absorb CO.sub.2 from air (e.g., Clark et al.,1992).  Once dissolved into water, this CO.sub.2 is rapidly transformed into bicarbonate and carbonate anions.  Under conditions of exposure to CO.sub.2-free air, or N.sub.2, or vacuum, high-pH alkaline solutions degas CO.sub.2 only very slowly.  This isa consequence of the (pH-increasing) slow kinetics of the process of the combined dehydroxylation (HCO.sub.3.sup.-.fwdarw.CO.sub.2+OH.sup.-) and dehydration (H.sup.++HCO.sub.3.sup.-.fwdarw.CO.sub.2+H.sub.2O) of bicarbonate anion in aqueous solution intodissolved CO.sub.2 (Grace and Piedrahita, 1993, 1994; Stumm and Morgan, 1996; Schulz et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2009; Cohen and Kirschmann, 2004; Moran, 2010).', 'Chemically, Lake Kivu deepwater is a CO.sub.2-rich Mg(Na)-carbonate water type of geothermal derivation (Tassi et al., 2009).  Its condition at depth is a natural example of CO.sub.2-based pH control over Mg and Ca precipitation.  Deepwater from375 meters depth has 15.6 millimolar (mM) magnesium at pH=6.15 (Tassi et al., 2016).  This is approximately 100.times.  saturation for a solution fully degassed under surface conditions at 1 atmosphere without atmospheric CO.sub.2 equilibration.  Thisfollows from the solubility product for magnesium hydroxide Ksp=[Mg.sup.2+][OH.sup.-].sup.2=1.5.times.10.sup.11.  This relation determines a molar solubility of 0.16 mM/l solubility for Mg(OH).sub.2 and a pH=10.5 for a saturated equilibrium solution at25.degree.  C. with no CO.sub.2 gas equilibrium present.  This condition is modulated to sub-saturation in Mg(OH).sub.2 and in Mg- and Ca-carbonates by CO.sub.2 in situ in Lake Kivu at 375 meters, as a consequence of the acidifying effect of dissolvedCO.sub.2 generating a pH of 6.15.  There is extremely high dissolved CO.sub.2 at 375 m depth in Lake Kivu: 62 mM/l, (2.7 g/l), (Tassi et al., 2009).  Magnesium hydroxide precipitates from aqueous solution at this Mg concentration at pH.about.10 onceCO.sub.2 in gas in equilibrium with the solution reaches a partial pressure .about.10.sup.-6, well below its present atmospheric partial pressure: .about.4.times.10.sup.-4 atm (Stumm and Morgan, 1996 edition 2, FIG. 5.2; Hanchen et al., 2008; Zolotov,2014).  Such circumstances are observed in hyperalkaline springs in Oman, but are rare in terrestrial surface waters (Neal and Stanger, 1984; Cipolli et al., 2004; Paukert et al., 2012; Chavagnac et al., 2013a,b; Monnin et al., 2014; Olsson et al.,2014).', ""Recent years have observed massive effort to develop industrialize CCU via organic synthesis.  A review is provided by Liu et al., (2015).  Major advances have been obtained in scientific insight such as overcoming endothermic constraints in thecatalytic copolymerization of CO.sub.2 as a C1 feedstock combining with olefins (e.g., Nakano et al., 2014) and polycarbonates.  CO.sub.2-copolymerized polypropylene carbonate (PPC) is 44% CO.sub.2 by weight (Darensbourg and Wilson, 2012).  This canprovide a major savings with respect to petrochemicals-sourced carbon mass.  Hence, some methods have been industrialized.  A prominent example was developed by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation of Japan.  Asahi's process produces polycarbonate plasticsusing inputs of CO.sub.2 and ethylene oxide (Fukuoka, 2012; Fukuoka et al., 2003, 2007, 2010).  Polycarbonates have been manufactured industrially in China since 2004 utilizing CO.sub.2 and propylene oxide (Wang et al., 2011)."", 'Carbon dioxide can be utilized as a low-cost feedstock for producing CO.sub.2 polyols in polyurethane production.  CO.sub.2 comprises roughly 50% of the mass of the CO.sub.2 polyols produced with CO.sub.2 incorporation as polycarbonate viaalternating copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides.  Industrialization of this process verifies the practicality of CO.sub.2 utilization in plastics manufacturing (Taherimehr and Pescarmona, 2014).  A substantial economic logic supports theproduction of plastics using CO.sub.2 polyols because, as noted above, carbon from low-cost CO.sub.2 replaces carbon from high-cost petroleum-based products.  For example, the cost of carbon from CO.sub.2 at .about.US$50/tonne can be compared to the costof carbon from petroleum-derived propylene oxide at .about.US$2,000/tonne.  Polyurethane is used, for example, to produce mattress foam (Langanke et al., 2013; von der Assen and Bardow, 2014; PU Magazine, 2013).', 'The German chemical giant Bayer has pioneered a CO.sub.2-utilization ""Dream"" technology (Prokofyeva and Gurtler, 2015) with German Government support (FMER, 2014).  Bayer will commence production of .about.5,000 metric tons per year of CO.sub.2polyols in Dormagen, Germany beginning in early 2016 under the name of its spin-off company ""Covestro"" (www.covestro.com; Smock, 2015).  The US company Novomer (www.novomer.com) developed and commercialized a similar CO.sub.2-polyols productiontechnology in 2014 (Anderson et al., 2012, 2013; Sawant, 2013; Novomer, 2013, 2014, 2015, and undated; Bioplastics, 2014).  Novomer\'s technology originated in research at Cornell University (Allen et al., 2006).  The British start-up company EconicTechnologies (www.econic-technologies.com) is developing a similar industrialization of CO.sub.2 polyols production (Kember, 2013; Sorlien, 2014; Broadwith, 2015).  Econic\'s technology is based on research at Imperial College, London (Kember andWilliams, 2012; Buchard et al., 2012; Chapman et al., 2015; Romain and Williams, 2015; Williams et al., 2015).', 'In the conventional process, polyurethane is produced by reacting polyols with isocyanate, typically with both polyols and isocyanate being petrochemical derivatives.  It now is possible for almost all of the component inputs for polyeurethanefoam to be obtained from CO.sub.2-polyols plus plant-sourced materials (Bonnaillie, 2007; Bonnaillie and Wool, 2007; Wool: U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,633,257 B2).  A wide range of non-petrochemicals-based ""green"" production chemistries for polyurethanemanufacture using bio-oils (and sometimes CO.sub.2 in additional modalities) have been developed and industrialized by companies such as Dow, BASF, Bayer, Cargill, Bio-Based, and Urethane Soy Systems (Llgadas et al., 2010; Bahr and Mulhaupt, 2012; He etal., 2013; Blattman et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Lee and Deng, 2015; Wikipedia: Natural oil polyols; Dow, undated).

Hydrogen peroxide is a basic input into many low-waste ""green chemistry"" processes, for example in the globally very high volume production ofpolypropylene plastics via propylene oxide (C.sub.3H.sub.6O) produced from propylene (C.sub.3H.sub.6).  Propylene (propene) typically is produced in industry petrochemically or via coal-based syngas processes, or via dehydrogenation of propane.  Hydrogenperoxide utilization allows a low waste synthesis of propylene oxide from propylene via the reaction: C.sub.3H.sub.6+H.sub.2O.sub.2.fwdarw.C.sub.3H.sub.6O+H.sub.2O.  Considerable effort has been invested attempting to develop an industrial method usingsupercritical CO.sub.2 as the reaction medium for hydrogen peroxide production via cleantech ""direct methods"" (that is, by: H.sub.2+O.sub.2.fwdarw.H.sub.2O.sub.2), (Hancu et al., 2002a,b; Chen and Beckman, 2007; Chen, 2007; Garcia-Serna et al., 2014;Pashkova and Dittmeyer, 2015; Edwards et al., 2015).  Direct production of H.sub.2O.sub.2 was industrialized by EVONIK and industrial partners using a nano-Pd--Pt ""NXCAT"" catalyst process developed by Bing Zhou at Headwaters Technology Innovation, Inc. This process used methanol as the reaction medium rather than scCO.sub.2.  It typically couples into propylene oxide production in its industrial applications, hence named the ""HPPO"" technology (Zhou, 2007, 2008; ThyssenKrupp, undated).  The combinedprocess now operates globally on a huge scale.  The hydrogen peroxide synthesis component of the process, however, can operate in scCO.sub.2 as well as in methanol.  This was demonstrated initially by Chen and Beckman, (2007).', 'Propylene production also can utilize CO.sub.2.  As noted above, propylene (propene) is a basic input into industrial plastics manufacture on a huge scale globally.  Propylene has been demonstrated by Dow to be bio-manufacturable by fermentationutilizing commodity sugar input, though not in an economically competitive manner (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Nextant, 2009).  Sugars derived from future lignocellulosic biorefining may change the economics.  At present, forms of ""bio-polypropylene"" can beproduced industrially from commodity polypropylene that is dilution-mixed together with up to more than 50% treated algal biomass input, grown on CO.sub.2 (Zeller et al., 2013; Cereplast, 2013; Algix, 2014).  Moreover, O.sub.2 inputs into hydrogenperoxide can be obtained as a byproduct of electrolytic CO.sub.2 reduction processes, whereas H.sub.2 can be obtained from biorefinery processing of algal and other types of biomass grown on CO.sub.2.  Therefore CO.sub.2 utilization inputs can besubstantial in propylene-based bioplastics production.  Propylene and ethelyne are manufactured industrially (together with gasoline and propane outputs) on a large scale worldwide from natural gas inputs via methanol in Lurgi\'s Gas-to-Chemicals (GTC)and Methanol-to-Propylene (MTP) technologies (Koempel et al., 2005; Jasper and El-Halwagi, 2015) as well as in broadly similar UOP-Honeywell Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) catalytic gas-phase synthesis processes (UOP, 2007, 2013, 2014).  Methanol synthesisfrom natural gas via syngas processing can use substantial CO.sub.2 input for process optimization (Luu et al., 2015; Milani et al., 2015).', 'Research developments indicate that economically industrializable catalysts may allow electrocatalytic production of ethylene (C.sub.2H.sub.4, also known as ""ethene"") by reduction of CO.sub.2 according to the overall reaction:2CO.sub.2+2H.sub.2O.fwdarw.C.sub.2H.sub.4+3O.sub.2 (Kuhl et al., 2012; Ogura, 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2015).  Worldwide production of ethylene exceeds that of any other organic molecule produced by reaction.  Ethylene typically isproduced by steam cracking of petroleum.  Its major use is in plastics manufacture by polymerization into polyethylene.  Polyethylene is the largest volume of any type of plastic produced worldwide.  Catalytic carbonylation of ethylene with carbonmonoxide allows a range of chemical synthesis reactions alternate to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (Makaryan et al., 2015).  Ethylene is oligomerizable into diesel and other liquid transport fuels (Heveling et al., 1998; OCMOL, undated).  The EU ""OCMOL""(Oxidative Coupling of Methane followed by Oligimerization to Liquids) consortium initiative (www.ocmol.eu) brought together a large group of chemicals and energy companies to develop this capacity.  Thus far, ""ethylene-to-liquids"" processes have beenindustrialized on a pilot scale by the company Siluria Technologies.  Siluria\'s processes allow attractive small-scale synthesis alternatives to large-scale indiustrial Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of fuels, plastics and other industrial chemicals(www.siluria.com).  They were developed for stranded natural gas utilization by a methane-to-ethylene process of oxidative coupling of methane, followed by ethylene-to-liquids processing.  Ethylene may become a basic output in the development ofso-called ""solar fuels"" using electricity from solar and/or other renewable sources to power water hydrolysis and CO.sub.2 reduction to ethylene followed by transformation into liquid transport fuels.  A reasonable basis in both science and economics hasbeen demonstrated by Singh et al., (2015).', 'Methanol is produced utilizing CO.sub.2 via direct catalytic conversion/reduction/hydrogenation via the reaction: CO.sub.2+3H.sub.2 CH.sub.3OH+H.sub.2O.  This can be an environmentally attractive form of CO.sub.2 utilization.  Methanolproduction from CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2 inputs depends for economic viability and environmental value upon the availability of either bio-hydrogen (as by enymatic processing of lignocellulosic sugars, for example) or low-cost electricity to obtain hydrogenby water electrolysis (Olah et al., 2009, 2011).  A piloting scale industrial example (4,000 tonnes per year production) has been created in Iceland by the company Carbon Recycling International (CRI: www.carbonrecycling.is).  CRU usesgeothermally-generated CO.sub.2 and electricity for electrolysis.  The project demonstrates the base level of the CO.sub.2-cycling ""methanol economy"" advocated by George Olah.  In Olah\'s vision, methanol can be used directly, or as a hydrogen-carrier, oras an input in various ways for industrial production.  One large-scale example of the latter, the ""methanol pathway"" in industrial production, is plastics manufacturing.  The methanol pathway already operates on a huge scale globally.  It is growingrapidly due to the economic incentives of switchover to natural gas feedstocks from petroleum feedstocks.  Methanol is a conveniently transportable product of natural gas reforming via well-known long-industrialized synthesis gas (""syngas"") processeing(Methanex, 2015).  China is especially active making this switch, replacing petroleum with methanol in the manufacture of plastics and industrial chemicals.  China imports methanol from the USA where it is manufactured from very low cost natural gas. World methanol production circa 2015 exceeds 60 million tonnes per year.  Therefore industrialization conditions are excellent for connecting CO.sub.2-utilizing direct synthesis of methanol (from CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2), wherever feasable economically,with industrial chemicals, fuels and plastics production.

For example, CO.sub.2 utilization in the form new ""smart solvents"" processing allows atechnologies suite for developing greentech production across a wide range of tasks in industrial chemicals manufacture and biorefining.  Algal biomass biorefining is another example where extraction processes utilizing supercritical and dense CO.sub.2alone as well as in mixtures with water, methanol and other solvents have been demonstrated (Soh and Zimmerman, 2011, 2012; Bjornsson et al., 2012; Soh et al., 2014; Goto et al., 2015; Du et al., 2013, 2015; Boyd et al., 2012; Reyes et al., 2014; Paudelet al., 2015).  The capability to extract lipids from wet algal biomass is a particularly significant breakthrough involving CO.sub.2 utilization, as well as DME (Goto et al., 2015) which can be produced utilizing CO.sub.2 input (as noted elsewhereherein).', 'In 2005, Professor Philip Jessop of Queens University in Canada developed a powerful ""green chemistry"" method of ""switchable solvents."" Switchable solvents utilize CO.sub.2 and N.sub.2 to switch the polarities and/or miscibility properties ofionic liquid solvents (Jessop, undated; Jessop and Subramanian, 2009; Jessop et al., 2005, 2011, 2012; http://www.switchablesolutions.com; Phan, 2008; Phan et al., 2008, 2009; Kerton, 2009; Mercer, 2012; Durelle, 2014; Vanderveen et al., 2014; Durelle etal., 2015; Boniface et al., 2016).  The nature of the process can include ""switchable hydrophilicity"" triggered by CO.sub.2 absorption into, and exsolution out of, a switchable solvent.  This capacity can switch a miscible water-solvent mixture into animmiscible situation of water separated from a (switched) hydrophobic solvent.  Phan et al., 2009 demonstrated use of this method for the extractive separation of soybean oil from flaked dried soybeans.  Extraction of soybean oil into a switchablesolvent was followed by addition of water, causing an immiscibility separation between the desired extracted oil product and a water phase into which the solvent was separeated and dissolved.  By addition of bubbled CO.sub.2 to this solvent-in-waterphase, a ""switching"" of solvent polarity resulted.  This created a 2-phase miscibility situation of water separated from a solvent-+-CO.sub.2 phase.  The latter phase allowed recovery of the solvent upon removal of dissolved CO.sub.2 by removing theCO.sub.2 atmosphere with nitrogen bubbling.  Boyd et al., (2012) and Du et al., (2013, 2015) have applied this type of method to lipid extraction from wet algal biomass.  Solvent swithing with CO.sub.2 allows solvent processing of wet algal biomasswithout an energy intensive biomass drying step.  It also allows lipid extraction with solvent recycling.  Such methods avoid the energy intensive step of distillation-separation for solvent recovery.  CO.sub.2 provides the ""switch"" that allows waterseparation and solvent recycling via miscibility rather than distillation.', 'Additional methods pioneered by the Jessop group have created CO.sub.2-switchable dehydration agents for the removal of water from organic liquids without distillation.  A significant example of the capability of this method is removal of waterfrom ethanol (Boniface et al., 2016).', 'Carbon dioxide can be utilized for carbon monoxide (CO) production.  One example is via the endothermic reverse Boudouard reaction: CO.sub.2+C.revreaction.2CO (Lahijani et al., 2014a; Wikipedia: Boudouard reaction).  This reaction has been shownto be modifiable usefully to lower temperatures with microwave stimulation (Hunt, 2013; Lahijani et al., 2014b).  Carbon monoxide is useful as a primary reducing agent in mineral smelting for value addition to mineral concentrates.  The classic reactionis coal gasification to CO in an atmosophere of CO.sub.2.  However, the Boudouard reaction also is useful without coal input in syngas production from biomass and/or municipal waste using inputs of CO.sub.2 such as pure CO.sub.2, or CO.sub.2--O2, orCO.sub.2-steam.', 'CO.sub.2 addition into biomass gasification is useful in two modes.  The first is that it acts as a ""gasifying agent."" CO.sub.2 addition into biomass gasification tends to increase both gasification extent and thermal efficiency, as described ina subsequent section.  The second mode is via CO.sub.2 utilization in conversion of (undesirable) char output within biomass gasification: increasing CO production from reduced carbon via the Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing the overall CO yield insyngas production (Kwon et al., 2009; Rafidah et al., 2011; Lahijani et al., 2014; Prabowo et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Yi et al., 2015).  In some situations where CO directed into chemicals manufacture, CO.sub.2 overall is net absorbed.  CO.sub.2-enhancedbiomass gasification can be utilized as a form of advanced greentech for combined power and hydrocarbon chemicals manufacture.  Many options are helpfully categorized and reviewed by Yi at al., (2015).', 'Another mode of production of carbon monoxide from CO.sub.2 is by electrolysis, also known as ""CO.sub.2 splitting."" Intense research has yielded a variety of potential modes of electrolytic CO.sub.2 splitting to produce CO and O.sub.2 incatalyzed aqueous reaction systems (Whipple and Kentis, 2010; Rosen et al., 2011, 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Tornow et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013, 2015; DiMeglio and Rosenthal, 2013; Jhong et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2013; Saheli-Khojinet al., 2013; Asadi et al., 2014; Medina-Ramos et al., 2014, 2015; Costentin et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014; Masel et al., 2014; Rosen et al., 2015; Mao and Hatton, 2015; Shen et al., 2015).  A breakthrough in efficiency is the use ofAu.sub.25 nanoclusters as an electrocatalyst, allowing a production efficiency of .about.3.8 MWh per tonne of CO.sub.2 split into separated CO and O.sub.2 streams (Kauffman et al., 2015).  ""Dioxide Materials"" is a start-up company created as a result ofresearch cited above created at the University of Illinois.  Dioxide Materials seeks to develop commercially scaled systems using a combination of electrolytic CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2O-splitting, producing CO, H.sub.2 and O.sub.2.  The purpose is to utilizeCO.sub.2 and renewable electricity as an alternate mode of production of fuels and industrial chemicals, replacing petroleum-based fuels and chemicals (www.dioxidematerials.com; ARPA-E, 2013; Masel et al., 2014; Dioxide Materials, 2014).  In addition tocarbon monoxide, direct production of formic acid by combined water and CO.sub.2 electrolysis is included within the company\'s agenda (Whipple and Kenis, 2010; Whipple et al., 2010; Jhong et al., 2013; Masel et al., 2014).', ""A non-aqueous modality of CO production from CO.sub.2 of particular interest is electrolysis in molten lithium carbonate, Li.sub.2CO.sub.3, developed by Valery Kaplan and colleagues in Igor Lubomirsky's research group at the Weizmann Institutein Israel (Valery et al., 2010; U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,906,219 B2).  The net electrochemical reaction is: CO.sub.2.fwdarw.CO+1/2O.sub.2.  It proceeds via Li.sub.2CO.sub.3 (molten).fwdarw.Li.sub.2O.sub.(dissolved)+CO.sub.(gas)+1/2O.sub.2(gas), balanced bycontinuous CO.sub.2 influx: Li.sub.2O.sub.(dissolved)+CO.sub.2 (gas).fwdarw.Li.sub.2CO.sub.3 (molten).  The process operates at .about.900 degrees centigrade.  It exhibits close-to-100% Faradaic and thermodynamic efficiency.  It provides separated gasflows of CO and O.sub.2 at the cathode and anode respectively."", 'A promising closely related mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is the method of electrolytic CO.sub.2 splitting in molten lithium carbonate developed by the research group of Stuart Licht at George Washington University (Ren et al., 2015; Li et al.,2015; Armitage, 2015; Licht et al., 2016).  This method splits CO.sub.2 into carbon nanofibers (C.sub.CNF) and O.sub.2 gas.  It operates with near 100% Coulombic efficiency.  (One mole of reduced carbon product is produced by .about.4 moles of appliedelectric charge.) Between 8 MWh and 16 MWh of energy input are expected to be required for practical production of 1 tonne of carbon nanofiber/nanotubes product, according to Ren et al., 2015, and Licht et al., 2016.  The lower end of this energy inputrange reaches and exceeds carbon neutrality for utilization of CO.sub.2 when compared to the amount of CO.sub.2 waste generated by generating process input power efficiently combusting natural gas.  Using solar power input of course can make this processstrongly CO.sub.2 absorbing.  The method offers a possibility for mass production of C.sub.CNF at a low cost with minimized expenditure of energy and with essentially zero associated waste.  A key question for the future is whether this method can berefined to produce carbon nanofibers efficiently in the high value forms of either Multiple Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNs), which have substantial value at .about.US$100,000/kg, or Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNs), which have extreme value in therange of .about.US$1,000,000/kg (Wilkinson, 2015).  SWCNs are distinctive for being low density (.about.1.4 g/cubic cm), while exhibiting the highest tensile strength (up to .about.100 GPa) of any known material along their tube direction, also with thehighest stiffness (elastic modulus) of any known material along their tube direction.  Industrial use of MWCNs and SWCNs has been developing since the key publication heralding their discovery in 1991 (Ijima, 1991).  A high cost of production has been asubstantial impediment against rapid uptake involving a very wide variety of high tech uses involving strength as well as electronic properties.  In principal, wires manufactures from carbon nanotubes could replace copper windings in electric motors. Carbon nanotubes could create the world\'s strongest, lightest-weight ropes and bullet-proof armor.  They also can add substantial strength into aluminum Al-alloy and other metals as nano-composites.  These materials also may have many future electronicuses: in batteries, capacitors, computational integrated circuits, photovoltaics and light-emitting materials.  Substantial early-stage industrialization using large quantities has been relatively simple thus far.  It has followed the technology offiberglass, using carbon nanotubes as a strengthening agent in materials created with epoxy matrix similar to other ""carbon fiber"" composites, only stronger and lighter.  An example of a manufacturer is the company Zyvex Technologies(http://www.zyvextech.com).  Zyvex has manufactured a range of epoxy resin based products using advanced carbon tube fibers in composites.  These have been used in aerospace materials, superlight military drone-boat hull fabrication, and various uses forlightweight strong materials in high-end sports equipment ranging from bicycle wheels to baseball bats to lacrosse sticks to sailboat masts.  The world market for carbon nanofibers, however, is small at present: perhaps less than 10,000 tonnes per year(Sherman, 2007; Johnson, 2014; Davenport, 2015; McKenna, 2015).  Energy efficient production of these very high strength nanomaterials can be environmentally favorable in the context of life cycle analysis (Khanna et al., 2008).  If produced at low costusing an efficient industriaization of the Licht method or developed analogs, CO.sub.2 utilization to produce carbon nanofibers has substantial potential for both export and local manufacturing industrialization.  The range of applications is immense fora low-cost production process (De Volder et al., 2013; Wikipedia: Potential applications of carbon nanotubes; NNI, 2014; Agarwal et al., 2010).  The Licht method electrolyzes CO.sub.2 absorbed into solution in a molten salt of lithium carbonate,Li.sub.2CO.sub.3, in the range .about.725 to 800 degrees centigrade.  Production of C-nanofibers proceeds according to the net reaction: CO.sub.2.fwdarw.C.sub.CNF+O.sub.2.  This is via: Li.sub.2CO.sub.3(molten).fwdarw.Li.sub.2O.sub.(dissolved)+C.sub.CNF(solid)+O.sub.2(gas) with fiber nucleation initiated and catalyzed by trace zinc and nickel.  A continuous process cycle is created by continuous absorbtion-infusion of CO.sub.2:Li.sub.2O.sub.(dissolved)+CO.sub.2 (gas).fwdarw.Li.sub.2CO.sub.3 (molten) with removal of the products C.sub.CNF and pure O.sub.2, with the latter being an additionally useful co-product.  Other similar electrochemical CO.sub.2 splitting technologiesproducing O.sub.2 and carbon filamentrary material in molten alkali salt and chlor-alkali salt systems have been demonstrated by Yin at al., (2013) and Ge et al., (2015).  The latter reports production of a form of amorphous carbon useful as negativeelectrode material for Li-ion batteries.  The general opportunity of molten carbonates for CO.sub.2 utilization is reviewed by Chery et al., (2015).', 'Other methods have been developed for CO.sub.2 utilization by reduction to produce high-value pure carbon products.  These include: C60 (Chen and Lou), Y-junction carbon nanotubes (Lou et al., 2006), diamond (Lou et al., 2003a,b, 2004) and densenanoporous graphene useful as the energy storage material in high-power supercapacitors (Xing et al., 2015; Science News, 2014).  Graphene and other C-based supercapacitor technologies have created many start-up companies.', 'CO.sub.2 can be utilized as an input to produce formic acid (HCO.sub.2H) via a number of catalyzed hydrogenation methods following the overall formulae: CO.sub.2+H.sub.2.fwdarw.HCO.sub.2H and CO.sub.2+H.sub.2O.fwdarw.HCO.sub.2H+1/2O.sub.2.  TheNorwegian Company Det Noeske Veritas, DNV-GL (https://www.dnvgl.com/) developed an innovation agenda in the area of renewable energy management addressing environmental risk.  DNV decided to develop a CCU expertise to produce formic acid (DNV, 2011;Sridhar et al., 2012; Agarwal et al., 2011).  DNV\'s techno-economic analysis (DNV, 2011) indicates formic acid offers a potentially economically attractive mode for industrializinging a power-to-liquids (PTL) technology: the transformation of electricpower, CO.sub.2 and water into industrial hydrocarbon liquids, including but not limited to fuels.  The attractiveness of electrochemical formic acid production according to DNV\'s analysis follows four factors: (i) the possibility to store electricalenergy with carbon recycling; (ii) technological potential based on efficiency performance for the hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation of formate; (iii) formic acid industrial utility apart from its specific use for energy storage; and (iv) a market pricesituation for formic acid favoring the electricity inputs required for electrolytic hydrogenation.  In respect of the fourth factor, DNV estimated that the electric power input cost for CO.sub.2-recycling electrolytic production was less than half of thecommodity price of formic acid.  (This price is based on the dominant production method of methyl formate hydrolysis employed by the formic acid producers BASF and Kemira-Taminco.  Methyl formate is produced from methanol and carbon monoxide inputs. Robledo-Diez, 2012.) An electricity input cost estimate is based on .about.4 MW-h per tonne of formic acid produced (DNV, private communication).  This corresponds to an electricity input price of .about.$400/tonne of 100% formic acid at a power cost of.about.US$0.10/kW-h. There has been special interest in Europe in both PTL and Power-To-Gas (CH.sub.4) CO.sub.2-recycling power-storage technologies.  This interest is for stabilizing the intrinsically irregular streams of electric power generated bywind and solar energy.  Stabilizing strategies that direct excess electric power flows into synfuels and industrial chemicals production are attractive if there are prospects for combining economic profitability with environmental sustainability.  Formicacid (H.sub.2CO.sub.2) possibly can operate with superior performance in this function as a CO.sub.2-based hydrogen carrier, allowing a carbon neutral process if renewable power sources are utilized.  Formic acid therefore provides a basis for a""hydrogen battery.""', 'The US start-up company ""Liquid Light"" (www.llchemical.com) developed out of electrocatalyst innovations at Princeton University in the PhD thesis of Emily Cole, advised by Professor Andrew Bocarsly (Cole, 2009; Cole and Bocarsly, 2010; Cole etal., 2010).  The company has developed, patented and demonstrated several electrochemical methods of reduction of CO.sub.2 into formate and formic acid (U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,562,811 B2).  These methods require inputs of CO.sub.2 and electricity.  Externalhydrogen gas inputs are not required because hydrogen is provided by the electrochemical process which includes water-splitting.  Liquid Light also has developed methods for CO.sub.2 electrochemical reduction to produce other industrial biochemicals. The company is focused especially on monoethelyne glycol (MEG) used in many industrial processes including production of plastic beverage bottles made from polyethelene terephthalate, PET (Law, 2015a,b).  Estimates provided in Parajuli et al., (2014)indicated electric power input costs in excess of the market price of formic acid.  However, these authors noted this was based substantially on a low process selectivity, CO.sub.2-to-formate of only 40%, with expectations of future enhancement.  (Aprocess improvement increase to 60% was documented in White et al., 2014.) Success in this agenda could offer useful opportunities for electrochemical production of formic acid utilizing CO.sub.2 input.  More broadly, Liquid Light represents an excitingagenda for industrializing CO.sub.2 recycling into industrial chemicals via electrochemical technologies.  As indicated by the company\'s name, a distinctive aspect of its vision is eventually to use photoelectric power and/or direct photocatalyticreduction of CO.sub.2 (White et al., 2014; Bocarsly, 2014).  At present, Liquid Light\'s main focus is on developing its CO.sub.2-utilization core platform for formate electrosynthesis linking to oxalic acid then MEG production for use in PET beveragebottles manufacture (Zhu et al., 2013; Law, 2015a,b; SRI Equity Research, 2015).', 'An imidazolium-modified gold catalyst developed by Toshiba has been demonstrated to allow production of ethylene glycol by electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide with high Faradaic efficiency (Tamura et al., 2015).', 'Hydrothermal conversion of CO.sub.2 and water into formic acid is a biomimetic mode of CO.sub.2 utilization developed by Fangmin Jin and collaborators.  This method couples CO.sub.2 reduction with water-splitting catalyzed by the oxidation ofzero-valent metals (Al, Mn, Fe, Zn, Mn), especially zinc in the presence of copper, in a metal/metal-oxide redox cycle (Wu et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2011, 2012, 2014; Zhang et al., 2011; Lyu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Demirel et al., 2015; Yao etal., 2015; Zeng, 2014; Wang et al., 2015a,b; Zhong et al., 2015).

It has traditional utility as a pickling agent in the tanning of hides, as a preservative in silage animal feeds, and as a coagulant in the production of rubber.  Ecologicallybeneficial uses replacing polluting industrial processes are of particular interest in the area of papermaking.  Formic acid has been known as an economically attractive wood pulping agent since 1983 (Bucholtz and Jordan, 1983).  It has been a pulpingcomponent in the environmentally beneficial ""Organosolv"" suite of technologies widely used in the pulp and paper industry, with special application to in the delignification of eucalyptus wood (Baeza et al., 1991).  Rousu et al., (2002) firstdemonstrated the utility of formic acid as the basis for an ecologically attractive closed-cycle greentech pulping process for fibrous agricultural waste integrated with biorefining: the ""Chempolis"" process.  The Rousu family industrialized this processin Finland via their company Chempolis (www.chempolis.com).  Formic acid can be used in the hydrolysis of bamboo cellulose to liberate sugars with high efficiency (Sun et al., 2008; Zhuang and Li, 2012; Kupainem, 2012; Hagesawa et al., 2013; Li et al.,2014).  Similarly, formic acid can be used to depolymerize bamboo lignin, and other sources of lignin, into valuable aromatic products such as, for example, vanillin (Rahimi et al., 2014).  Additionally, formic acid can be used as an effectivedelignifying pulping agent for banana stem waste in papermaking (Mire et al., 2005; Jahan et al., 2007; Sridach, 2010; Sannigrahi and Ragauskas, 2013).  Formic acid biomass treatment technology utilizing bamboo and banana tree waste and other non-foodforms of biomass has many potential future bio-production applications additional to the direct one of papermaking.  These range from sugars separation and production (from bamboo: principally glucose .about.41% and xylose .about.22% by weight: Li etal., 2012) to high-efficiency catalysis-based and also enzymatic bio-hydrogen production from sugars (Li et al., 2015; del Campo et al., 2013; Rollin et al., 2015), to fine bio-chemicals production in many and various modalities (Philbrook et al., 2013),to ethanol production by fermentation (Littlewood et al., 2013).  Xylose can be processed into the valuable ""tooth-friendly"" food sweetener sugar-alcohol ""birch sugar"" xylitol (Dupont-Danisco trade name: ""Xivia"") which inhibits dental decay and ismedically indicated for sucrose substitution for diabetics.

Easel Biotechnologies is focusedon bioproduction of electrofuels.', 'The start-up biotechnology company Gingko Bioworks (www.gingkobioworks.com) bioengineered chemoautotrophic microbes capable of transforming formate input into a variety of biochemicals and biofuels (Lane, 2015).', 'Carbon dioxide can be utilized by the co-electrolysis (or ""co-splitting"") of CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2O together in high-temperature solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs).  With intake of CO.sub.2, H.sub.2O and electric power, SOECs yield an anodeoutput of pure O.sub.2 gas and a cathode output of syngas (H.sub.2 and CO), according to the net reaction: H.sub.2O+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.O.sub.2+(H.sub.2+CO), (Ebbesen et al., 2009; Ebesen and Mogensen, 2009; Graves, 2010; Graves et al., 2011; Mogensen, 2013;Chen et al., 2013; Stempien et al., 2013; Badwal et al., 2014).  This technlogy allows storage of electrical energy (typically intermittant renewable energy when in excess) into methanol, DME and other synthetic liquid fuel outputs of syngas production(GTL).  SOEC co-electrolyzer systems also can provide oxygen output.  The technology is integrable with various modes of biomass gasification and upgrading (CO.sub.2 methanification) and power generation, and with syngas production as noted above. Overall, CO.sub.2 utilization-recycling via co-electrolysis with water in SOECs is a substantially promising and flexible ""green"" technology likely to be implemented in Europe future low-CO.sub.2 energy and fuels economy.  SOEC co-electrolysis andrelated technologies have been developed in a serious manner in Denmark with initial industrialization by the company Haldor Topsoe collaborating with a large research group at the Technical University of Denmark (Minh and Mogensen, 2013; Ridjan et al.,2013; Ryde, 2014; Hansen, 2015; Jensen, 2015).  The German company ""Sunfire GmbH"" (www.sunfire.de) has commercialized a SOEC-based Power-to-Liquids system.  Sunfire\'s method uses H.sub.2 produced in a SOEC from steam (with O.sub.2 byproduct).  ThisH.sub.2 is reacted with CO.sub.2 input into syngas flowing into Fischer-Tropsch reactors.  The combined process produces diesel and other synfuels with 70% capture of energy input into caloric value output in the synfuels (Sunfire, 2014).  Developmentactivity for SOEC co-electrolysis in the US is reviewed by Stoots (2011).  Research describing a technologically different modality to co-electrolyze CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2O with variability control in the H.sub.2/CO ratio of syngas output has beendescribed by Kang et al., (2014).  Also, Walsh et al., (2014) demonstrated a potentially low-cost modality of co-electrolysis of CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2O catalyzed in an aqueous flow using a molybdenum catalyst with multi-walled cabon nanotubes.  Theprocess yields an H.sub.2/CO molar ratio of 2, ideal for methanol production.', 'Professor Jacob Karni of the Weizmann Institute developed a thermal process for the co-dissociation ""splitting"" of CO.sub.2 plus water vapor (Karni, 2011) into syngas and oxygen.  Research of his group led to the formation of the start-upcompany NCF/NewC O.sub.2-Fuels (http://www.newco2fuels.co.il/about/).  This company is now a subsidiary of Australia-based GreenEarth Energy, Ltd (http://www.greenearthenergy.com.au).', 'Carbon dioxide can be utilized combined with methane for syngas production by catalyzed gas phase reactions for Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) production of methanol and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon fuels.  For example, carbon dioxide can beutilized via the endothermic ""dry reforming"" reaction CO.sub.2+CH.sub.4.revreaction.2CO+2H.sub.2 to produce syngas with H.sub.2/CO=1, though the net ratio is lower due to heat production required by the reaction.  (See: Noureldin et al., 2015).  Onewell-established example of commercialized industrial CO production by dry reforming natural gas or LPG with CO.sub.2 is the ""Calcor"" process.  This process was created by the German company Caloric Anlagenbau GmbH (Tuener et al., 2001).', 'Several modes exist for CO.sub.2 input into syngas production in combination with natural gas for the purpose of producing methanol and/or other synthetic fuels and chemicals (Luu et al., 2015).  ""Methane oxyforming"" (sometime called""Oxy-CO.sub.2 reforming"") utilizes inputs of methane, CO.sub.2, water and O.sub.2.  It involves combinations of steam reforming of methane (CH.sub.4+H.sub.2O.fwdarw.CO+3H.sub.2), dry reforming of methane (CH.sub.4+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.2CO+2H.sub.2), andpartial oxidation reforming of methane (CH.sub.4+1/2O.sub.2.fwdarw.CO+2H.sub.2).  With inclusion of dry reforming, this combination utilizes CO.sub.2, yielding the net reactions: 3CH.sub.4+O.sub.2+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.4CO+6H.sub.2, and5CH.sub.4+2O.sub.2+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.6CO+10H.sub.2 (York et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2010).  A variation known as ""tri-reforming"" adds-in the catalytic combustion of methane, releasing heat: CH.sub.4+2O.sub.2.fwdarw.CO.sub.2+2H.sub.2O.  Tri-reforming hasbeen developed as a possible widespead industrial modality of utilizing impure CO.sub.2 from flue gases to create synthetic fuels (""synfuels"") and chemicals by Fisher-Tropsch and related processes (Song, 2001, 2006; Song and Pan, 2004; Jiang et al.,2010).  Fisher-Tropsch GTL historically has been limited to very large scale industrial complexes (Lewis, 2013).  However, the situation has changed drastically with the development of a new market for small-scale GTL plants.  The plants are beingcreated for the utilization of ""stranded gas"" all over the world (Jacobs, 2013).  Most of the existing companies involved are reviewed in a 2014 Word Bank report and slide deck by Fleisch, (2012, 2014).  Companies include: Oberon Fuels(www.oberonfuels.com, Oberon Fuels, undated), Velosys (www.Velocys.com, Velosys, undated), CompactGTL (www.compactGTL.com, CompactGTL, undated), GasTechno (www.GasTechno.com, GasTechno, undated; Breidenstein, 2015), Greyrock Energy (www.greyrock.com,Grey Rock Energy, undated) and Maverick Synfuels/(www.mavericksynfuels.com; www.mavericknorthstar.com).  Small-scale GTL plants allow the conversion of ""stranded"" natural gas obtained from pipeline-isolated wells, into valuable products in combinationwith inputs of CO.sub.2, water and sometimes separated oxygen, combined in various mixtures.  Maverick has a line of small ""Oasis"" GTL plants focused on methanol production (Maverick Synfuels, 2014, undated).', 'Another process utilizing CO.sub.2 is the production of acetic acid (CH.sub.3COOH, or CH.sub.4CO.sub.2).  Acetic acid is the active substance in vinegar obtained by fermentation of ethanol.  It is a basic input into many industrial synthesisprocesses.  World demand is .about.12 million tonnes per year circa 2015 (Tweddle, 2014).  Acetic acid produced for industrial use typically has been made by a non-biological syngas production process via methanol.  To produce acetic acid, methanol iscarbonylated with input of carbon monoxide, initially via the ""Monsanto process"" and later in the ""Cativa process."" In 2014, BP announced it had developed an improved large-scale industrial synthesis via the ""SaaBre process,"" based on coal-to-syngasand/or natural gas reforming (Pavlechenko, 2014).  BP announced it would apply the new synthesis method in a large facility planned for Oman (2b1st Consulting, 2014).  The Gas Technology Institute is developing a direct catalytic gas synthesis GTLproduction process for acetic acid based on CO.sub.2 and methane inputs (CCEMC, 2014).  Acetate also can be produced using CO.sub.2 directly by electrochemical reduction of CO.sub.2.  For example, impressive lab results were described by Yanming Liu etal. (2015) for an aqueous system using a non-metallic catalyst: nitrogen-doped nanodiamond deposited on the surface of an array of silicon micropillars.', ""Industrial bioproduction of acetic acid has been practiced for many centuries via the fermentive oxidation of ethanol by aerobic acetic acid bacteria (Ebner and Sellmer-Wilsberg, 2002; Raspor and Goranovic, 2008; Mamlouk and Gullo, 2013).  Anhistoric step towards CO.sub.2 utilization in acetic acid bioproduction relates to the discovery of an acetone-butanol fermentation process used in the production of explosive munitions (smokeless powder cordite).  A major breakthrough was developed byChaim Weizmann, later first President of Israel, who patented a high-productivity process based upon the fermenting capacities of the aneorobic acetogenic (Hartmanis and Gatenbeck, 1984; Millat et al., 2011, 2013; Jeon et al., 2012) acetone-producingbacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum.  This was in the UK in 1915 in the urgent wartime emergency of WWI (Jones and Woods, 1986; Krabben, 2014; Weizmann Magazine, 2015).  Weizmann's method fed biocultures with various feed sources such as corn and potatomash starch and molasses glucose.  However, more recently, broadly related industrial acetate bioproduction methods have been developed using gas inputs of CO.sub.2 and/or CO, with and without H.sub.2 addition, as carbon sources (Barker et al., 1945;Levy et al., 1981a,b; Worden et al., 1991: Daniell et al., 2012).  Such processes follow what is believed possibly to be the oldest carbon-fixing process on Earth, utilizing CO.sub.2 and CO.sub.2+H.sub.2 inputs (Poehlein et al., 2012) in a process knownas gas fermentation.  Acetic acid is produced by microbial gas fermentation with input of both syngas and CO.sub.2+H.sub.2 mixtures (Daniell et al., 2012; Liew et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2014; Latif et al., 2014; Kantzow et al., 2015; Devarapalli andAtiyeh, 2015; Durre and Eikmanns, 2015; Nybo et al., 2015).  Acetate production from CO.sub.2+H.sub.2 gas fermentation is by cell excretion into the surrounding water medium.  Therefore producing cells do not have to be harvested.  Productivity can beextremely high in specialized bioreactors.  Yields up to 148 g.sup.-1 d.sup.-1 acetate have been observed via a continuous dilution process of extraction from cell cultures of gas fermenting Acetobacterium woodii (Kantzow et al., 2015)."", ""LanzaTech (www.lanzatech.com) is a dynamic global company focused on carbon recycling via gas fermentation biotechnology (Kopke et al., 2010, 2011; Daniell et al., 2012; Liew et al., 2013; Harmon, 2015, Holmgren, 2015).  LanzaTech and two othercompanies, INEOS Bio and Coskata, have industrialized gas fermentation for commodity ethanol production from syngas (Kopke et al., 2011; Durre and Eikmanns, 2015).  LanzaTech and its several industrial partner companies utilize process gas (for examplefrom steel mill operations) and/or syngas (for example from biomass gasification) to feed microbes in large bubbled tanks yielding ethanol and other output commodity chemicals.  LanzaTech also can utilize CO.sub.2-rich input gas compositions.  Forexample, the company's website describes a partnership with the Indonesian oil and gas and petrochemicals company Petronas to industrialize a process to utilize CO.sub.2 by gas fermentation with CO.sub.2+H.sub.2 inputs using LanzaTech's geneticallyengineered platform organism (De Guzman, 2012).  The process described uses gas fermentation to produce acetic acid.  This then feeds a second fermentation process producing lipids.  These lipids can be separated into two components: high-valuenutraceuticals and a residue used for biofuels production (Daniell et al., 2012; LanzaTech, website; Goyal, 2014; Holmgren, 2014).  LanzaTech's biological synthesis utilizing CO.sub.2 employs what is thought to be the one of the Earth's oldest metabolicpathways.  This is the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of microbial CO.sub.2 reduction/fixation utilizing hydrogen to produce acetic acid.  The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway proceeds according to the overall stochiometry:4H.sub.2+2CO.sub.2.fwdarw.CH.sub.3COO.sup.-+H.sup.++2H.sub.2O, (Wood, 1991; Wood and Ljungdahl, 1991; Drake, 1994; Ragsdale and Pierce, 2008; Fuchs, 2011; Schuchmann and Muller, 2014).  It is one of the modes whereby methane is produced in Lake Kivu viaan acetogeneisis pathway in its sediments (Tietze at al., 1980; Leigh et al., 1981; Schoell et al., 1988; Lliros Dupre, 2009; Bhattarai et al., 2012; Pasche et al., 2011; Wuest et al., 2012)."", 'An example of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway operating is another industrial CCU mode: adding CO.sub.2 to increase methane production in the anerobic digestion of sewage (Bajon Fernandez, 2014; Bajon Fernandez et al., 2014, 2015; Yasiin et al.,2015; Koch et al., 2016).', 'A modified mode of CO.sub.2 utilization to produce acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway without hydrogen addition is ""microbial electrosynthesis."" Microbial electrosynthesis requires inputs of CO.sub.2 and electricity.  The biology involved isa recent discovery.  It is fascinatingly interesting as well as open to innovations from synthetic biology to create new product output modes (Cheng et al., 2009; Lovely, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015; Nevin et al., 2010, 2011; Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010; Rabaeyet al., 2011; Lovley and Nevin, 2011, 2013; Jeon et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Logan and Rabaey, 2012; Hawkins et al., 2013; Lovely et al., 2013; Wang and Ren, 2013; Zaybak et al., 2013; Lovely and Malvankar, 2015; Bengelsdorf et al., 2013; Ueki et al.,2014; Xu et al., 2014; Bertsch and Muller, 2015; Durre and Eikmnns, 2015; Jourdin et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2015; Tremblay and Zhang, 2015; Gildemyn et al., 2015; Choi and Sang, 2016; www.electrofuels.org; www.geobacter.org).  LanzaTech has developed apilot-scale commercial biology platform to produce acetate and other commodity chemicals with this type of biotechnology (Mihalcea, 2015; Holmgren, 2015; Lai, 2015; Griffin, 2015) via both methods: (i) CO+H.sub.2 and/or CO.sub.2+H.sub.2 gas fermentation,and (ii) ""electrotrophic"" microbial electrosynthesis utilizing CO.sub.2+electrons as inputs.  The company also has developed a platform using heterotrophic algae to transform acetate into the high-value omega-3 nutraceutical fatty acid DHA (AsianScientist, 2014; Holmgren, 2014).  OakBio is an additional start-up biotech company active in similar areas: utilizing CO.sub.2-rich flue gases from cement production as inputs into gas fermentation to produce bioplastics (OakBio, 2014; Theulen,2015a,b).', 'CCU to convert CO.sub.2 to methane can be by means of a biological phenomenon called ""electromethanogenesis"" (Cheng et al., 2009) Electromethanogenesis can convert CO.sub.2 into CH.sub.4 using the input of electrons directly consumed byelectrotrophic microbes (Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2012, 2013 2015; Van Eerten-Jansen, 2014; Hara et al., 2013; Lohner et al., 2014).  H.sup.+ in water serves as the hydrogen source (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2015; Beese-Vasbender et al.,2015; Tremblay and Zhang, 2015).  Or electromethanogenesis can use other biological utilizations of electron inputs.  Some very interesting laboratory results have been obtained using methanogenic microbes indigenous to depleted oil fields with interestto discover methods to produce methane underground via CO.sub.2 flooding with electrical input (Kobayashi et al., 2012; Kuramochi et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2015; Maeda et al., 2015; Mu et al., 2014; Mu and Moreau, 2015; Vilcaez, 2015;Koide and Yamazaki, 2001; Beecy et al., 2001).  This effort offers a new horizon in the field of Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery, MEOR (Youssef et al., 2009).  Very high conversion CUU efficiencies to produce methane and various biochemicals have beenobserved for hyperthermotrophic systems involving both H.sub.2 pathways and direct electrotrophs (Keller et al., 2013, 2015; Sato et al., 2013; Hawkins et al., 2011, 2013; Hawkins, 2014; Maeda et al., 2015; Zeldes et al., 2015).  These findings followbasic quantitative insights into biological thermodynamic as well as engineering process efficiencies.  They suggest that CCU optimalities for ""biosolar fuels"" and ""biosolar chemicals"" are likely to be found in this direction (Hawkins et al., 2011, 2013;Bar-Even et al., 2012a,b; Ducat and Silver, 2012; Frock and Kelly, 2012; Fast and Papoutsakis, 2012).  It is too early to know if such biological power-to-gas methods utilizing CO.sub.2 will have sufficient efficiency to have commercial potential.  Theobservations and insights are quite new and important, especially as the barriers to economic viability for biofuels other than ethanol are very substantial (Papoutsakis, 2015; Dimitrou et al., 2015; Han et al., 2015; Roken and Greenblatt, 2015) andrequire large efficiency improvements.

Three company partnerships have developed bioisoprene production for ecological bio-tire manufacture: (i) Genencore/Dupont and Goodyear; (ii) Amyris and Michelin, and (iii) Ajinomoto and Bridgestone (Scandola,2015).  All of the bioproduction methods involved utilize non-gas carbon sources.  Isoprene has been targeted for production via gas fermentation by LanzaTech as well as the US chemical giant DuPont.

DME is an alternative fuel that can replace both propane and diesel (Semelsberger et al., 2006; Fleisch et al., 2012;GGFR-Fleisch, 2014).  DME is useful as a propane/LPG replacement by blending or total substitution.  It can be used within the propane/LPG infrastructure.  It has substantially lower heating value compared to LPG.  However, it fills more mass intostandard LPG bottles.  In competition between these two factors, the energy per bottle fill is 82% relative to LPG (IDA, 2010).  Therefore DME can provide bottled home and business cooking gas based on a methane source, alternate to propane.  DMEreplaces diesel fuel with minor engine modifications plus fuel storage in LPG-type tanks.  It has the highest well-to-tank efficiency ratio of any transport fuel made from natural gas (Semelsberger et al., 2006).  DME also is environmentally attractivebecause it is clean-burning.  It has attractive performance relative to diesel.  Oberon Fuels (www.oberonfuels.com) is specialized in a two-stage syngas-process production of methanol followed by DME utilizing inputs of methane and CO.sub.2 (see:Lautzenberg, undated).  Oberon\'s optimal target input mixture is 72% CH.sub.4 and 28% CO.sub.2, volume percent (corporate website and Corradini et al., 2014: U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,809,603 B2).  A different tri-reforming technology exists for single-stepsynthesis of DME.  It is via a syngas process using inputs of methane, steam and CO.sub.2.  The process was industrialized by the Korea Gas Coporation, KOGAS in the mid-2000s (Cho et al., 2009, 2011; Chung et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015).

This is via a method allowing efficient recycling of DME in the vapor phase (Kanda, 2011; Kanda et al., 2012, 2015; Boonnoun etal., 2014; Goto et al., 2015).', 'Methanol (CH.sub.3OH) production is one industrial mode of using CO.sub.2 on a potentially very large scale, offering an attractive liquid fuel modality for hydrogen storage (Behrens, 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Perez-Fortes et al., 2016;Al-Kalbani et al., 2016).  Methanol and its derivative DME have been advocated with a biomass source as the basis of a green fuels economy by the Nobel prize winning chemist George Olah and colleagues at USC (Olah et al., 2009; Goeppert et al., 2014).

If, however, a mixture of hot steam and CO.sub.2 already is available in the right molar ratio as an industrial by-product, then bi-reforming can simplify to its second stage process with a CO.sub.2-utilizing net reaction:3CH.sub.4+CO.sub.2+2H.sub.2O.fwdarw.4CH.sub.3OH.  It becomes a CO.sub.2 utilization process for methanol production by addition of methane utilizing inputs of CO.sub.2 and steam.  Additional insights into the utilization of CO.sub.2 in syngas productionroutes to methanol are provided by Baltrusaitis and Luyben (2015).', 'A goal of recent research is to develop improved methods of low-cost industrial catalytic hydrogenation of CO.sub.2 to methanol using H.sub.2 inputs.  Hydrogen inputs may be obtained indirectly, such as H.sub.2 obtained from water splittingusing renewable electricity (Olah, 2013; Goeppert et al., 2014; Behrens, 2014, 2015; Demirel et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Studt et al., 2014, 2015), or from the chlor-alkali process for chlorine (Cl.sub.2) manufacture by electrolysis of NaCl (Kiss etal., 2016).  Or hydrogen may be obtained via integrated chemical processes that include water-splitting, for example hydrothermal methods with coupled metal/metal-oxide redox cycling (Jin et al., 2012; Huo et al., 2012; Demirel et al., 2015; Lyu et al.,2015; Ren et al., 2015).  Hydrothermal processing also can reduce formic acid into methanol with coupled metal/metal-oxide redox cycling (Zeng et al., 2011, 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2012).  Industrialization of CO.sub.2 hydrogenation tomethanol using hydrogen from water-splitting with renewable power has been achieved in Grindavik Iceland at the George Olah Plant (www.carbonrecycling.is; Wikipedia entry: Carbon Recycling International; Tran, 2010, 2011; Harp et al., 2015).', 'Professor Atsushi Urakawa at the ICIQ in Tarragona, Spain, created a one-pass catalyst method for converting high-pressure H.sub.2 and CO.sub.2 inputs into methanol or DME with high selectivity (Bansode and Urakawa, 2014; Bansode, 2014; Urakawaand Bansode, U.S.  Pat.  No. 9,133,084, ""Process for the preparation of methanol and methanol-derived products from carbon oxides."") This method also allows production of alkane or alkene products with a coupled second reactor.', 'CO.sub.2 can be utilized in combination with methanol to produce dimethyl carbonate (DMC) according to the CO.sub.2-utilizing reaction: 2CH.sub.3OH+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.(CH.sub.3O).sub.2CO+H.sub.2O.  DMC has potential for large-scale industrial use. It is an eco-friendly solvent used in the manufacture of paints.  It also has very large scale potential, well-demonstrated, as a pollution-decreasing oxygenating additive to gasoline and diesel fuels (Honda et al., 2013).  It moreover is used as anelectrolyte in Li-ion batteries, as well as as a base material for polycarbonates production.  Four synthesis routes, three reacting supercritical CO.sub.2 with methanol, and the standard industrial process combining O.sub.2 and CO with methanol arereviewed by Saavalianen et al., (2015), Wen et al., (2015), Santos et al., (2014) and Rivetti et al., (1996).  Several electrolytic methods also are known.  And at least two industrialization agendas are ongoing for a CO.sub.2-utilizing direct reactionmethod (Austrian Institute of Tecnology, 2015; CCEMC-E3Tec Services, L L C, 2014).', 'CO.sub.2 also can be utilized in combination with ethanol to produce diethyl carbonate (DEC) according to the reaction: CH.sub.3CH.sub.2OH+CO.sub.2.fwdarw.(CH.sub.3CH.sub.2O).sub.2CO+H.sub.2O (Gasc et al., 2009; Leino, 2015; Prymack et al.,2015).  DEC is a widely used feedstock in various synthesis routes in petrochemical productions.  And, like DMS, it has potential for large-scale future utilization as an oxygenating cleanfuel additive for both gasoline and diesel.  It also is used as anelectrolyte in Li-ion batteries.', 'Syngas for methanol production is obtainable by other means such as from biomass gasification.  A full demonstration exists on an industrial scale in Sweden (Gillberg, 2012, 2013; Ridjan et al., 2013; Kolmogoren, 2014; Danish MethanolAssociation, 2011; Pedersen and Schultz, 2012; BioMCN, 2013; Landalv, 2014).  Syngas with the desired composition, H.sub.2/CO .about.2.0, can be produced from biomass by two modes involving input of CO.sub.2 as a biomass gasifying agent/reactant.  Theseare: (i) by input of CO.sub.2 reacting with dried biomass with or without steam, or (ii) by input of CO.sub.2 with wet slurry biomass promoting gasification reactions in highly pressurized supercritical water.  The latter situation is especiallyadvantageous for use of harvested algal biomass that has not been dried or centrifuged to remove intra-cell water (thus saving a large component of energy expenditure).  Biomass gasification with input of CO.sub.2 reacting with dried biomass with orwithout steam has been researched extensively.  Results indicate that CO.sub.2 input can be modulated to obtain a target output of syngas with the ratio H.sub.2/CO .about.2.0.  Reaction chemistries are observed with high gasification yields and thermalefficiency in conditions with or without steam (Butterman and Castaldi, 2007, 2008, 2009a,b, 2010, 2011; Prabowo et al., 2014, 2015a,b,c; Kwon et al., 2015; Yi et al., 2015).', 'Biomass gasification in supercritical water with CO.sub.2 input has been modeled by Frietas and Guirardello (2012, 2013, 2015).  Model results suggest CO.sub.2 input modulation to obtain H.sub.2/CO .about.2.0 (optimal for methanol production) ispossible.  However, the high pressure and temperature process conditions are non-trivial for industrialization.  Also the output syngas contains CO.sub.2.  Overall, CO.sub.2-enhanced biomass gasification does not absorb CO.sub.2 in the net of thereactions.  However, it has the effect of suppressing the formation of excess CO.sub.2 over input CO.sub.2 in the output in comparison with syngas production without CO.sub.2 input.  CO.sub.2 input increases gasification efficiency.  Importantly, it alsoreduces the problematic formation of tars and chars.  Biomass gasification of algal biomass in supercritical water also has the special advantage of allowing nutrient recycling by salts separation immiscibility between an aqueous phase and other oil-richand/or gas phases (Yakaboylu et al., 2015).', 'A potentially large-scale future mode of CCU may follow from a cell-free electrosynthesis method of""artificial photosynthesis."" The method utilizes enzymes in an electrical water splitting system to transform CO.sub.2 and water into O.sub.2 andcarbohydrates such as sugars or starch.  Energy stored in sugars is expected to become an efficient power storage method via enzymatic hydrogen release and also eventually, via carbohydrate fuel cells.  This vision is being pursued by Percival Zhang andhis research group at Virginia Tech (Zhang, 2010, 2011, 2013; Zhang and Huang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).  Zhang\'s group has developed a cell-free method of enzymatic production of hydrogen from biomass (e.g., Rollin et al., 2015).  Shi et al., (2015)provide a review of the field of enzymatic conversion of CO.sub.2.  Future developments in ""artificial photosynthesis"" technology development may benefit from from the fact that carbon dioxide reduction to methane and C2 hydrocarbons can be catalyzed bya single biomimetic enzyme, a remodeled nitrogenase (Yang et al., 2012; Rebelein et al., 2014, 2015).', 'More generally, solar power linked with electrolytic water-splitting and CO.sub.2-utilizing ""artificial photosynthesis"" (Ciamician, 1912; Inoue et al., 1979; RSC, 2012; Purchase and de Groot, 2015) produces ""solar fuels"" (Harriman, 2013;https://rtsfi.rti.org/RTSFI what.html) and ""solar chemicals"" (Gates, 2015).  This is an active and rapidly expanding field of research, device invention and entrepreneurial company formation (Olah, 2005; Olah et al., 2006; Barton et al., 2008; Walter etal., 2010; Lewis, 2011; Meyer et al., 2011; Lewis and Nocera, 2012; RSC, 2012; Barber and Tran, 2013; Handoko et al., 2013; Lewis, 2013, 2016; Berardi et al., 2014; Cox et al., 2014; Grahn et al., 2014; Ronge et al., 2014; Schlumberger, 2014; Wang etal., 2014; Ashford et al., 2015; Bonke et al., 2015; Alissandratos and Easton, 2015; Fenwick et al., 2015; Izumi, 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Su et al., 2015; Highfield, 2015; May et al., 2015; Modestino and Haussener, 2015; Peter, 2015; Schreier et al.,2015; Shin et al., 2015; Torella et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; White et al., 2015; Wikipedia: ""Artificial photosynthesis""; Martin, 2016; Purchase and de Groot, 2016).  The field includes many different technology modalities.  It is being funded by thesupport of several governments in strategic programs (Faunce, 2012; Marshall, 2014).  It is experiencing a high rate of innovation towards the possibility of industrial take-off (Herron et al., 2015).  Three basic agendas are involved: (i) directphotochemical CO.sub.2 reduction; (ii) CO.sub.2 electrochemical reduction via electrochemistry or electro-biochemistry powered by solar-sourced electricity; and (iii) electrolysis of water to produce H.sub.2 followed by use of this H.sub.2 forindependent CO.sub.2 hydrogenation or electrochemical reduction or thermochemical reaction with CO.sub.2 into product chemicals (such as formic acid, methane, methanol, etc.).  Efforts to commercially industrialize artificial photosynthesis include largecompanies such as Panasonic, Toshiba and Lockheed-Martin (Nagata, 2015), as well as start-ups such as Liquid Light (www.llchemical.com), HyperSolar (www.hypersolar.com), Dioxide Materials (www.dioxidematerials.com), Sun Catalytix (purchased bywww.lockheed martin.com), Sunfire (www.sunfire.de), and NewCO.sub.2Fuels (www.newco2fuels.co.il).', 'This vision for artificial photosynthesis connects with business initiatives creating large-scale photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) electricity production units in high radiation intensity desert areas, for example Nur Energiein the desert of North Africa (www.nurenergie.com).  Large solar power facilities in deserts eventually will produce fuels and industrial chemicals once doing so becomes economically competitive with long distance electricity sales and/or with the marketcost of liquid fossil fuels used for transportation.  The commercial future for the ""solar economy"" of artificial photosynthesis and CSP chemicals production (e.g., www.newco2fuels.co.il; www.solar-jet.aero; Romero and Steinfeld, 2012; Marxer et al.,2015) using CO.sub.2 as a carbon source is presently (circa 2015) overshadowed by low-cost fossil fuels.  However, both PV and CSP technologies are following well-demonstrated innovation trends of increasing efficiencies with decreasing costs in theirindustrial applications.  Also, the science of catalyst design for industry is progressing rapidly.  Moreover, most technologies for CO.sub.2 electrochemical reduction can utilize power from a variety of additional renewable sources including hydropower,wind power and biomass- and biogas-based power.  Therefore, industrialization of CO.sub.2 reduction electrochemistries is generally to be expected for the future.  The agenda for artificial photosynthesis with CO.sub.2 recycling (the ""solar chemical""agenda) is gaining traction in an environment of widespread and growing international commitment to develop efficient CO.sub.2 recycling as a key part of a green technology transformation of the world energy economy on a very large scale (e.g., Gates,2015; www.breakthroughenergycoalition.com; King et al., 2015; King, 2016; Carrington, 2015; www.globalapolloprogramme.org; www.nurenergie.com; Moller, 2012; Wikipedia entry: Desretec; www.desertec.org; www.desertenergy.org; Trieb, 2013; Schlumberger,2014).  Favorable situations include locations where large quantities of purified CO.sub.2 are available for free or at very low cost, where ""green"" venture-subsidies and low-cost investment capital are available, where low-cost electricity is available(for example from hydropower and/or future advanced low-cost solar mega-arrays), where co-produced O.sub.2 can be utilized efficiently for oxyfuel combustion, and where prices are high for products due to suituations such as, for example, remoteness fromports.  A ""solar fuels roadmap"" for South Africa is reviewed by van Ravenswaay et al., (2015).', ""The East African region contains very high solar radiation intensity regions, especially in typically cloudless regions of northwestern Uganda, NW Tanzania, and in northern and western Kenya.  These areas are observable in GeoModel Solar'stime-averaged horizontal irradiation map of Africa (Solargis, 2011).  Some areas are favorable for the development of large solar arrays.  An example is the 40 MW solar PV array being developed for installation in northern Kenya by the companyGreenmillenia Energy, Ltd (www.greenmillenia.com; Breakbulk, 2015.  A plan to create a much larger 320 MW PV solar park in central Kenya has been announced (Kumar, 2015).  Also, a 50 MV PV solar park being developed by the Chinese firm CJIC ineast-central Kenya (Nduire, 2015).  Power from such arrays can be transported efficiently over long distances by high voltage direct current (HVDC).  Technologies for grid development using HVDC technology are developing rapidly.  Effective use of largeinputs of solar power feeding directly into industrialized artificial photosynthesis will be favored by the development of efficient energy storage methods for load balancing to provide a continuous and level power output."", ""Despite these many, scientific and engineering insights, designs, teachings, products, methods, systems, business activities, safety threats, development-industrialization needs, and ecologically significant opportunities having to do with LakeKivu, its deepwater resources, and CO.sub.2 utilization, no efforts have been made to design inventive methods and/or systems to co-extract and co-utilize the lake's abundant CO.sub.2 resource in the context of extracting and utilizing its methaneresource.

For example, FIG. 2 contains three boxes labeled""Box 1,"" ""Box 2,"" and ""Box 3,"" but also contains separate items numbered 1, 2 and 3.  These clearly are illustrated as distinct entities.  In such cases (also in FIG. 8), ""X.BoxY"" in the text is used to reference ""Box Y"" in the figure, these beingdifferent from items in the same figure labeled ""Y"" (referenced ""X.Y"" in the text).  Boxes sometimes are labeled simply by numerals as ordinary items, (though as boxes indicating associated operationally integrated collections of items).  Boxes alsosometimes are identified with numerical labels surrounded by a small solid line box possessing rounded corners.  Use of such small boxes with rounded corners surrounding number labels is a form of highlighting for purposes of clarity.  Such highlightedlabels always identify larger boxes.

It reveals to the Republic of Rwanda, and more broadly to the Kivu region of the DRC, an unprecedented possibility and opportunity for global leadership in advanced greentechindustrialization, specifically in productive utilization of CO.sub.2 in amounts equal to the world's largest industrial flows of CO.sub.2.  The location of Lake Kivu close to the geographical center of the African continent offers an economicallyfavored opportunity for CO.sub.2-utilizing industrial production of products that are expensive to import from the coast.  CO.sub.2 utilization also offers ways to produce a large number of high-value export products.  The scale of the opportunity isvery large within its context.  A doubling of Rwanda's rate of per capita economic growth is possible."", 'Carbon dioxide has never been extracted from a lake for industrial use.  No prior art exists in this specific category of activity.  Carbon dioxide has been vented from lakes in Cameroon and in Spain (Halbwachs et al., 2004; Kling et al., 2005;Sanchez-Espana et al., 2014) for safety purposes using auto-siphoning pipe-jet fountains.  There has been no capture and utilization of the gas.', 'Lake Kivu\'s dissolved gases trapped at depth are a mixture of methane and CO.sub.2.  This situation presents a difficulty: too much CO.sub.2 is present for efficient combustion such that gas-cleaning stages are required, causing substantialefficiency losses.  This problem has been solved by the inventor in a previous disclosure documented herein presenting a method and system of ""total gas"" extraction into an oxyfuel combustion heat engine that exhausts nominally pure CO.sub.2 (exceptingwater vapor which can be removed easily if desired).  The situation also presents a difficulty for the use of the CO.sub.2 present, as noted, in a vast store in Lake Kivu of approximately 600 million tonnes.  The invention disclosed herein discloses amethod and system that allows hyper-efficient utilization and effective separation of both methane and CO.sub.2.  This is via two variant processes: one involving modification of existing methane degassing methods, systems, designs and apparatus, and theother in conjunction with the oxyfuel method of power generation which utilizes unseparated ""total gas"" degassed by deepwater extraction degassing without a separation method separating CO.sub.2 from methane.  It is surprising that it can be possible tounlock Lake Kivu\'s resources in such efficient ways without wasting either CO.sub.2 or methane.  In the present disclosure, the primary focus is on unlocking Lake Kivu\'s CO.sub.2 resource in coordination with efficient capture and use of Lake Kivu\'sbiomethane reserve.  Degassing CO.sub.2 additionally can secure lake safety against a limnic eruption mega-catastrophe.  This is a vital associated goal.', ""As noted herein, industrial sources of CO.sub.2, when obtained from natural occurrences, typically are nominally pure.  A particularly pertinent example is the Kereita Forest spring source (actually a drilled fountaining jet of water andCO.sub.2) used by the Kenyan company Carbacid (CO.sub.2) Limited (www.carbacid.co.ke).  Carbacid (CO.sub.2) Limited provides and sells CO.sub.2 from this source for use in beverage carbonation all over East Africa.  It is ironic that businesses operatingon the shores of Lake Kivu buy Carbacid CO.sub.2 obtained from the distant Kereita Forest while 600 million tonnes is trapped nearby, and when nearby volcanoes and mazuku vents bordering the lake naturally emit perhaps as much as 30 million tonnesCO.sub.2 per year into the local atmosphere.  Another ironic aspect is the way the standard technology practiced on Lake Kivu returns CO.sub.2 into the depths of the lake (and thereby extends the mortal danger from a possible limnic eruption).  As theMSDS method and system disclosed herein shows, CO.sub.2 can de degassed by a relatively simple design modification.  However, when the standard design was created, it was not obvious how such large amounts of degassed CO.sub.2 could be used, whereas itgenerally is well understood that venting CO.sub.2 to the atmosphere is environmentally problematic.  The present disclosure provides the surprising insight that many useful uses exist.  These sum together to a very large scale of potential CO.sub.2utilization.  Unlocking Lake Kivu's trapped mega-source of CO.sub.2 offers a transformation by the creation of a massive flux of purified, naturally-sourced CO.sub.2 herein estimated roughly as .about.9 million tonnes per year.  That is a surprise."", 'Separating CO.sub.2 by means of modifying the traditional staged degassing system design (SDS to MSDS as shown in FIG. 8) yields CO.sub.2 with residual methane present.  It does not yield a purified CO.sub.2.  (Avoiding methane wastage is one ofthe efficiency gains of the variant process based on total degassing followed by oxyfuel combustion.) This type of methane-laced CO.sub.2 has a special utility as an aquatic carbon source.  When carbon dioxide in injected into the biozone, anyaccompanying methane can be utilized by oxidizing bacteria present in the biozone.  Such bacteria can utilize methane as an energy source and also as a carbon source.  Their growth can increase overall bioproductivity.', ""A particular challenge the invention addresses is CO.sub.2 utilization on a scale sufficient to match the scale of CO.sub.2 degassed in power plant operations obtaining Lake Kivu's methane and degassing its deepwater CO.sub.2.  For the Rwandanside of the lake this scale is roughly 10 million tonnes of CO.sub.2 per year.  That approximately equals the largest single source CO.sub.2 extraction flux in the world (from a CO.sub.2 well used to supply CO.sub.2 for EOR in west Texas, USA).  Hereinit is shown that at least 1/3.sup.rd of powerplant (OXFCPS) CO.sub.2 flux can be utilized valuably in direct connection with treatment of powerplant return flow reinjection into the lake.  It is shown that this fraction increases to over 1/2 withinclusion of related CO.sub.2 utilization processes set by levels of different resources present in the deepwater.  Several other CO.sub.2 utilization processes can boost the overall level of CO.sub.2 utilization to match the total level of flux.  Theinvention demonstrates that it is possible to utilize the full scale of CO.sub.2 flux in an industrially productive manner.  This is shown in Table 2."", 'The Lake Kivu region is magnificently attractive.  The area has strong eco-tourism potential.  It could be spectacular for real estate development.  Accelerated development of the area will require concrete and other building materials forroads, culverts, bridges, runways, dams, buildings, tunnels, piers, docks and walkways.  Magnesium-mineralized CO.sub.2 can provide a source of mineral carbonate mass for advanced construction materials sourced from CO.sub.2 combining with precipitatedmagnesium hydroxide, and also via carbonation of additional pozzolanic materials from abundant local volcanic ash sources.  The region possesses densely populated hyper-fertile lands with a strong farming tradition.  It is a situation likely to beenthusiastic for the development of CO.sub.2-boosted very-high-yield greenhouse horticulture.  Farmers can utilize urea made with deepwater CO.sub.2 and bio-ammonium to intensify crop yields in the region, and to expand agro-production for exportingflowers, high-value specialty foods, plant extracts and other exports.  These can include a wide variety of potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products linked with CCU.  Pyrethrum production offers a substantial opportunity for organicbiopesticide production linked with CO.sub.2 because it is a longstanding crop in the region.  The wider region also has huge potential for minerals/metals extraction with value-add ore processing.  A low-cost CO.sub.2 supply can assist several modes ofmetals extraction and value-add processing, as noted herein.  These range from use of carbon monoxide in smelting tin to new technologies of coltan value-add refining, to dunite-olivine carbonation for production of silicon-, magnesium-, and iron-richplant fertilizers, as well as eco-nickel from Mg-carbonate mineralization of CO.sub.2.  The wider Lake Kivu region has huge potential for dry ice distribution.  Dry ice can provide efficient off-grid refrigeration linked with beverage and fooddistribution.  To the west, the great Congo forests have substantial potential for sustainable forestry products development.  Production possibilities exist in many areas of CO.sub.2-utilizing industrial technology, ranging from bioplastics tobiochemicals to biosynthetic textiles, to paper, xylitol, wallboard production and biofuels.  All of these types of forest biomass-related products utilize CO.sub.2, and some use formic acid that can be produced from CO.sub.2.  To the east are hugereserves of alkaline brines and soda ash already being used for sodium bicarbonate production.  Sodium bicarbonate can be used in high-value algal products production.  It also is useful in biomass and mineral ores processing.  To the north,multi-billion barrel opportunities exist for extraction of oils supported by CO.sub.2-EOR technologies.  Oil fields exist in the range 150 to 400 km distant from Lake Kivu.  To the east, radiation-optimal locations for solar power arrays in NW Tanzania,NW Kenya and NE Uganda.  These areas are attractive for solar power generation for the purpose of powering production of CO.sub.2-utilizing ""solar fuels""/""electrofuels"" production.  High voltage wires can transport solar power from these regions to theCO.sub.2 supply at Lake Kivu.  Lake Kivu biomethane can be used with CO.sub.2 input to produce Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) biomethanol for transport fuel admixing.  Large-scale algae production utilizing CO.sub.2 as a carbon source offers opportunities forhigh-value nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals production as well as biofuels, bio-asphalt, bio-nitrogen and bio-char fertilizers, CO.sub.2-utilizing bioplastics, and other green chemicals.  In the future, many attractive commercialized technologies willemerge for large-scale CO.sub.2 utilization, for example, high-value carbon nanofiber and nanotubes production from CO.sub.2.', 'Numbers describing resource abundances in Lake Kivu deepwater and deepwater inflows are provided in Table 1 scaled to 100 MW for electric power output.

This scale is based on combustion efficiency optimization suggested by a business partnership that manufactures advancedoxyfuel turbine systems.

Input data for this calculationare provided in Table 1.  A rough maximum scale for CO.sub.2 utilization corresponds to degassing of the entire budget of CO.sub.2 in Lake Kivu (.about.600 million tonnes) in .about.30 years plus 50 MT biomethane converted to CO.sub.2 mass (=138 MTCO.sub.2).  This amounts to a production of roughly 700 to 750 MT CO.sub.2 in 30 years, hence up to: .about.25 MTA CO.sub.2.

These are shownwithin boxes 1, 2 and 3 as represented in the figure: (i) degassing in a total degassing system (TDS: 1) that includes extracting (6) gas-rich deepwater (9c) from Lake Kivu (9a,b,c); (ii) power production and CO.sub.2-dominated exhaust creation by meansof an oxyfuel combustion power system (OXFPCS: 2) which intakes (and includes production of) pure oxygen for oxy-combustion (10); and (iii) receiving, processing and utilizing CO.sub.2 in a CO.sub.2 utilization hub (CO.sub.2-UH: 3), with the overallactivity generating electrical power as well as various types of product streams from various modalities of CO.sub.2 utilization (8).

Detailed physical specifications for components may be many and varied such as correspond to matters of design at a levelof detail unrelated to the inventive art disclosed herein.  Such matters are known to those skilled in the art.  The CO.sub.2-UH: (i) receives exhaust either from the OXFCPS comprised of a nominally two-component mixture of CO.sub.2 and steam, or in thevariant MSDS-based method and system as CO.sub.2 and water vapor; (iii) processes this gas flow initially, if and as needed, for example in some embodiments via heat exchange energy capture, and in some other embodiments by gas dehydration, or withcombination of both; (iv) partitions and directs the resulting gas flow into one or more process trains; (v) prepares and produces such flows through one or more of these process trains for utilization in one or more ways, for example as a mode of rawgas (in some process trains), or in various grades and forms of CO.sub.2 (in other process trains), and/or uses the resulting gas flows from one or more of these process trains to produce products requiring CO.sub.2 inputs (in other process trains)and/or requiring the use of CO.sub.2 in their production (in other process trains).  In certain preferred embodiments, one or more process trains may share cryogenic functions with the ASU component of the OXFCPS.  In certain preferred embodiments,process trains purposed for CO.sub.2 refrigeration are co-utilized for cryogenic gas processing, storage and dispersing of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen and/or liquefied natural gas (LNG).  In summary, the CO.sub.2-UH in its operation transforms theflow of CO.sub.2-containing exhaust from the OXFCPS into flows of various CO.sub.2 products, and/or CO.sub.2-containing products, and/or products manufactured with the use of CO.sub.2.

FIG. 2 shows in schematic representation the invention as an industrial processarising out of Lake Kivu's layered structure represented by arrows, circles and boxes.  Deepwater resources of dissolved gases are extracted (22), and then utilized (26, 21, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).  Thesedeepwater resources are present principally, (but not exclusively), in Lake Kivu's so-called Main Resource Zone (23c).  FIG. 2, box 2 encloses schematically the method and system of a CO.sub.2-UH (21) organizing the transformation of inputs (28; 32; 39),especially CO.sub.2 plus water vapor (28), into outputs (item 33), comprising twenty or more main modes (represented in FIG. 2 by vectors 1 through 20).  The industrial process creates products that include electric power (29) produced by an oxyfuelcombustion power production method and/or system (26; 27; 28; 29) including an air separation unit (27).  In the TDS-based variant of the invention, the power production method and system is the OXFCPS.  It is shown as a circle (26) linking together anexus of inflows (25; 27) of fuel gases (25; 27) and outflows of power (29) and post-combustion exhaust (28).  The main carbon source input into the CO.sub.2-UH is the post-combustion exhaust (28) expelled by the OXFCPS.  The CO.sub.2-UH receives,stores, dispenses and utilizes this exhaust, which is comprised mostly of carbon dioxide and water, either in the form of vapor or condensed liquid water.  It uses electric power, either internally produced by the powerplant (as represented by outputvector 29), or from any other source.  Inputs of any type needed for production are represented by vector 32.  These inputs enter into the CO.sub.2-UH.  The industrial process (and method and/or system) also produces a suite of carbon-containing (andhence carbon-capturing) industrial products [1 through 20 as outputs (33) of CO.sub.2-UH (21)]. Outputs are created by means of submethods and/or subsystems organized within an integrated CO.sub.2-UH submethod and/or subsystem (21) shown with outputs (1to 20) within box 2.  The CO.sub.2-UH is defined herein to include within its domain any modality and combination of modalities of CO.sub.2 utilization and associated product outflow based upon CO.sub.2 inflows obtained from Lake Kivu in the course ofdeepwater methane-based power production, including both deepwater CO.sub.2 and CO.sub.2 formed from combustion of deepwater methane (or, in the case of the MSDS method and/or system, deepwater CO.sub.2 only)."", 'FIG. 2 shows Lake Kivu on the bottom left in vertical slice perspective in three layers (23 a, b, c).  These are: the bottom ""Main Resource Zone"" (23c: MRZ: .about.250 to .about.485 meters depth), the near-surface ""BioZone"" (23a: BZ, 0 to.about.80 meters depth) and a middle zone (23b: .about.250 to .about.80 meters depth).  The middle zone as shown is a combination of two zones: the ""Potential Resource Zone"" (PRZ) and the ""Intermediate Zone"" (IZ), represented in scientific andengineering reports describing the gas resources and limnological structure of the lake (Descy et al., 2012; Wuest et al., 2012a,b).  The industrial process begins with the extraction of deepwater in a system of flow organized by one or more riser pipesubmethods and subsystems (22).  See, e.g., US 2015/0354451 A1.  These submethods and/or subsystems transport deepwater rich in dissolved methane and CO.sub.2 into a degassing submethod and/or subsystem (24).  This should be considered to include theriser or risers (22) themselves.  The degassing submethod and/or subsystem (22, 24) separates the inflow of gas-rich water (22) into outflows of separated degassed water (34) and separated gases (25).  Separated degassed water is transferred by asubmethod and/or subsystem of return flow pipes, pumps and containing reservoirs (34, 35) that variously control the reinjection of return flow waters into Lake Kivu via various options (36a, 36b, 36c).  These reinjection options are not exclusive of oneanother.  Preferred embodiments thereof are described, as noted herein, in other disclosures focused on Lake Kivu made by the inventor.  The variant MSDS-based form of the invention is shown in FIG. 1.', 'As shown in FIG. 2, separated gas from the TDS (22, 24, 25, as shown in box 1) comprised mostly of CO.sub.2 plus methane plus water vapor is transported and processed, if and as needed, for input into an oxyfuel combustion system (26, 27) intowhich oxygen is added via an air separation unit (27) which is a component of the powerplant (26, 27).  Combustion of methane with pure oxygen transforms the input gases (25, 27, 31) into mechanical power used to generate electric power (29) and anoutput exhaust stream (28) comprised of mostly CO.sub.2 plus condensable water vapor.  FIG. 2 shows a post-combustion exhaust stream (28).  It provides oxyfuel powerplant combustion exhaust of carbon dioxide and steam as input into a CO.sub.2 utilizationhub (CO.sub.2-UH, item: 21).  In the variant MSDS-based form of the invention, the connection between the degassing system and the CO.sub.2-UH is simpler, as represented by item 14 in FIG. 1.', 'CO.sub.2 is provided in post-combustion exhaust expelled by the OXFPCS (which may or may not be a combined cycle).  It also is provided by degassed CO.sub.2 from a MSDS.  These sources of CO.sub.2 initially enter a processing, storage andpurveying/distribution unit (30), shown in FIG. 3.  This unit (30) processes, handles and stores input exhaust (28) and disperses the flow into different streams.  (It is the subject of FIG. 3, which in part displays its components, methods, systems andactivities.) These streams are comprised of CO.sub.2 products in different forms symbolized by eight specific arrows corresponding to modalities of use (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).  A flux vector labeled as item 37 represents the use of any of theseCO.sub.2 product streams internally within the CO.sub.2 utilization hub for additional modes of product manufacture utilizing CO.sub.2 (8 through 20).  (Note that arrow number 8 is intermediate.  It is both a mode of CO.sub.2 product and a mode ofcreating products utilizing CO.sub.2.) Overall, in the sum of any to all of its preferred embodiments, the CO.sub.2-UH can produce an overall output of products shown as vector 33.  This output is comprised of one or more of a suite of carbon-containingand purified and non-purified CO.sub.2 products, plus products produced using CO.sub.2 in some way but not incorporating its carbon.  One non-purified CO.sub.2 product is a stream of ""raw"" (unprocessed or relatively unprocessed) CO.sub.2 and steam orcondensed water (vectors 1, 2, 3 and 4).  It may be disseminated and diffused into the biozone (23a: BZ) of Lake Kivu in order to provide a carbon source for photoautotrophic bioproductivity, as shown for vectors 2a and 2b.  Or this form of CO.sub.2 maybe provided to local greenhouses, as shown by vector 1.', 'As shown in FIG. 2 by flux vector 31, oxygen gas output may be obtained as a byproduct of chemical production and/or bio- or artificial-photosynthetic processes and/or water electrolysis in the CO.sub.2-UH (21).  Such oxygen may be used forincreased power production efficiency by supplying a component of oxygen otherwise provided by the Air Separation Unit (27, utilizing atmospheric air input shown as vector 41).', 'As shown in FIG. 2, the ASU (27) also produces liquefied nitrogen gas, (LN.sub.2) separated from oxygen gas (39, 40).  Some of this LN.sub.2 is used internally within the ASU for cryogenic energy recovery by means of cooling incoming air via aheat exchange process.  In certain preferred embodiments, excess LN.sub.2 from the ASU is provided (42) into the gas processing, storage and handling unit (30) of the CO.sub.2-UH, as shown by vector 39.  Or it may be provided otherwise for otherpurposes, as shown by vector 40.', 'FIG. 2, Box 3, illustrates adjunct utilization of excess liquid nitrogen and/or oxygen (via flow vectors 39 and/or 40 and/or 42) to cool one or more large refrigeration utilization facilities (43), such as, for example, a digital data center. Flow vectors 39 and 42 flow into the liquefied gas storage units within the gas-processing (30) sector of the CO.sub.2-UH (21), (see process train 25, units 30 and 31 in FIG. 3).  In FIG. 2, box 3, the vectors labeled 39 and 42 indicate either directflow from the ASU (27) or flow from LN.sub.2 and LO.sub.2 storage facilities as shown in FIG. 3.  (In FIG. 3, LO.sub.2 and LN.sub.2 storage units 30 and 31 connect via insulated pipe transfer systems labeled 37 and 38, respectively.) Post-cooling flowsof gasified N.sub.2 (44) are available for various uses such as, for example, can be engaged to pH control and related algae culturing operations as illustrated partially in FIG. 8, Box 3, return flow water treatment (flow direction 16).  Post-coolingflows of gasified LO.sub.2 (45) are provided into oxyfuel combustion (item 27).  Aspects of such gas plumbing associated with utilization of cryo-energy for cooling as well as for cryo-storage of energy are represented in FIG. 6 and explained inaccompanying text describing the utilization of LO.sub.2 and/or LN.sub.2 and/or refrigerated liquefied O.sub.2 (LCO.sub.2 or LCO.sub.2) for this purpose.  For reasons of already considerable complexity, FIG. 2 avoids representing these aspects of theinvention.  They are reserved for FIG. 6 and its explanations.', 'In certain preferred embodiments, LN.sub.2 is utilized for cryoenergy storage for load balancing purposes, facilitating the operation of the OXFCPS (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2).  This stored energy is released by heat exchange with atmospheric airand/or powerplant exhaust, whereby the phase-changed expanding gas drives a power-producing turbine heat engine.  See FIG. 6.', 'In certain preferred embodiments, storage of liquefied oxygen (LO.sub.2) similarly provides stored cryo-energy.  Similarly, this cryo-energy is released by heat exchange with the atmosphere, and/or powerplant exhaust, whereby the phase-changedexpanding gas drives a power-producing turbine heat engine wherewith and whereby the warmed-up O.sub.2 emerging is fed into oxy-combustion in the OXFCPS.  See FIG. 6.', 'In certain preferred embodiments, refrigerated liquid CO.sub.2 is utilized for cryoenergy storage for load balancing purposes, thereby facilitating the operation of the OXFCPS powerplant (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2).  Stored cryo-energy present inthe CO.sub.2-UH as stored refrigerated liquid CO.sub.2 is releasable by conversion into electricity by heat exchange with atmospheric air and/or by heat exchange with the exhaust of the powerplant.  The phase-changing expanding gas drives apower-producing turbine.  In this way, refrigeration-liquefaction of CO.sub.2 is used as a CO.sub.2 storage mechanism for energy storage.  (Of course refrigerated-liquefied CO.sub.2 also is sold into the market as a product of the CO.sub.2-UH.) Therefrigeration-liquefaction process requires input of power from the powerplant, typically at night when power demand from the grid is low.  In a day-night cycle, a substantial fraction of this cryogenically stored energy is recovered, typically duringthe day, when power demand from the grid is high.  Phase-changing expanding CO.sub.2 gas is warmed by heat exchange.  For best system efficiency, this heat exchange is via cooling the intake of air fed into the ASU and/or by utilizing exhaust heat fromthe powerplant as a higher temperature heat source.  After the phase-changing expansion of CO.sub.2 drives a power-producing turbine engine, the warmed-up gas then is fed into various modes of utilization via the CO.sub.2-UH.  Further representation anddiscussion of this capacity for CO.sub.2 utilization is provided in FIG. 6 and its accompanying discussion.', 'In certain preferred embodiments, the CO.sub.2-UH, and/or the ASU cryosystem, and/or both working in concert, receives inputs of solar power transmitted by one or more long-distance transmission wires, transmitted to support various modes ofproduction utilizing CO.sub.2 inputs, or transmitted in the context of a need for load balancing.  Cryogenic energy storage using practically liquefiable gases, N.sub.2, and/or O.sub.2, and/or CO.sub.2 allows balancing of the irregularity of flows ofsolar power into the grid such that a continuous regularized flow of power input may be sustained into CO.sub.2-utilizing modes of production.  Additionally, the cryogenic energy manipulation and storage capabilities of the overall method and system ofthe invention provides capacities suitable to serve load-balancing needs that are generic for solar power provision into the grid.  Turn-around power storage efficiencies by such methods are expected to be >60% (power out/power in), and possibly ashigh as 95%, as described in references cited herein (cf, Park et al., 2017).  Certain preferred embodiments include this capability to receive solar power and provide energy storage for load balancing to regularize the input of solar power to the grid.', 'In certain preferred embodiments, the CO.sub.2-UH, and/or the ASU cryosystem, and/or both working in concert, provide(s) cryogenic energy storage load-balancing services for the management of one or more electrical power grids connecting intothe invention as implemented (in the same manner as described for the input of solar power in the section immediately above).', 'FIG. 2, box 1 is a schematic representation showing the delimitation of the invention in relation to Lake Kivu and in respect to various elements diagrammed within the figure and the names of the submethods and subsystems indicated by theiracronyms.  (An equivalent diagram is not shown for the simpler case of the MSDS-based variation of the invention.  FIG. 1, box 13 and CO.sub.2 flow line 14 are sufficient for this purpose in combination with detail provided in FIG. 8.) The invention hasspecific applicability to problems and challenges of Lake Kivu (represented by the circle labeled number 38 which also represents the combinative domain of the invention), specifically to safe, efficient, optimally productive deepwater resourcesutilization.  The invention solves problems and challenges of Lake Kivu such as efficient power production, securing long-term lake safety, environmental responsibility, and economic innovativeness and productivity by utilizing CO.sub.2.  It does so bycombining submethods and/or subsystems within three subdomains operating in inter-coordination.  These are shown as circles within the larger circle marked ""Lake Kivu"" (38) in Box 1: (i) deepwater extraction (22), degassing (22, 24), and gas transfer andprocessing for dehydration and/or H.sub.2S removal (25), if and as needed, preparatory to oxyfuel combustion; (ii) oxyfuel combustion (26, 27) with inputs of separated deepwater gases (25) and oxygen (27, 31), and outputs of electric power (29) andexhaust comprising nearly pure CO.sub.2 with condensable H.sub.2O (28); and (iii) a CO.sub.2-UH submethod and/or subsystem (21) which produces, in the limited set of examples provided for purposes of description, a suite of twenty main modes ofcarbon-containing product production (1 through 20, and in sum: 33) including CO.sub.2 for biozone input (vectors 2a, 2b and 3), utilizing the input of exhaust (28) expelled from the oxyfuel power plant (26, 27).  Note that 20 modes are provided only forreasons of limiting the discussion to a reasonable package of examples, whereas the invention is generically open to any modes of CO.sub.2 utilization such as might support realistic business activities or at least developmental research and developmentin order to create business activities via developmental investment.', 'FIG. 2, box 2 shows aspects of the operation of the CO.sub.2 utilization hub (21: CO.sub.2-UH).  The CO.sub.2-UH (21) transforms the exhaust (28) from the OXFCPS (26, 27) plus additional inputs (32), into horticultural, aquacultural, andindustrial output main modes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 33).  Table 2 lists them and provides additional information.', 'FIG. 3 provides detail on five types of gas processing trains present within the CO.sub.2-UH (as shown in FIG. 2 as item 30 without any detail).  Note that the process shown in process train 22 is different from processing trains that produceCO.sub.2 products.  Train 22, however, demonstrates production utilizing relatively ""raw"" CO.sub.2 with respect to the exhaust output of the OXFCPS.  These trains and their various combinations are all preferred embodiments.  In FIG. 3, the fiveprocessing trains are labeled 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26.  Horizontal dashed lines separate these five processing trains.  FIG. 3 exhibits four cases of the production of CO.sub.2 products (rows marked by circles numbered 23, 24, 25, 26), and one case ofmanufacturing a product incorporating CO.sub.2 (22).  The five different submethods and subsystems of receiving, processing, storing and purveying CO.sub.2 (rows 23, 24, 25, 26), and CO.sub.2-incorporating products (row 22) are referred to herein as""process trains."" A dashed box (dashed box 36) encloses a representation of subsystems and submethods present in certain preferred embodiments.  These connect and integrate cryogenic capacities of the OXFCPS involving liquefied nitrogen (31) and oxygen(30), with cryogenic capacities of process trains 25 and 26.', 'FIG. 3 shows the initial reception of raw exhaust (1) from the OXFCPS or MSDS (as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2).  Initial processing of OXFCPS raw exhaust gas, in certain preferred embodiments, includes capture of heat energy by a heat exchangerconnected to a power production unit.  Such a submethod and/or subsystem, a Heat Exchanger Power Production Unit (2: HEPPU) is represented by (and/or identical to) a fence-like symbol within box 2.  A drain, shown as an icon labeled 3 (present in fourlocations within the figure), drains condensed water from the HEPPU (2).  In some embodiments, this heat exchanger power unit is a part of the OXFCPS.  In other embodiments, the HEPPU (2) is included within the CO.sub.2-UH.  FIG. 3 shows it as thelatter.  The distinction is simply a definitional choice.  FIG. 3 shows five different modalities of CO.sub.2 handling, processing and disposition for use (22, 23, 24, 25, 26).  In one case (22), CO.sub.2 is directly utilized.  This utilization is in asense referring to the transformation of CO.sub.2 into a product that is not itself CO.sub.2, or otherwise more broadly refers to any industrial process that utilizes CO.sub.2 but that is not overlapping with CO.sub.2 processing into other forms ofCO.sub.2.  In the others cases (23, 24, 25, 26), CO.sub.2 in various forms is modified and made available for delivery as a CO.sub.2 product.  Thus four of the five modalities are for CO.sub.2 products as shown for process trains 23, 24, 25, and 26.', 'In FIG. 3, the process train modality, labeled 23, is production of relatively unprocessed gas into short-term process storage (9).  This storage (9) is shown as a pressurizable chamber allowing condensation and removal of water (icon: 3) priorto pumping (10) of stored CO.sub.2 for use.  The next flow stage in this process train is low-pressure pipeline delivery (11a, b).  The double representation (11a and 11b) indicates a multiplicity of uses, but does not indicate either a necessity ofmultiple uses or an absence of multiplicity for outputs of the other process trains shown.  CO.sub.2 in this relatively low-pressure form delivered by pipelines is for local and/or semi-local horticultural and/or aquacultural and/or return-flow-modifyinguses, as shown in FIG. 2.', 'In FIG. 3, the process train modality labeled 24 is production of dehydrated pressurized gas.  Dehydration steps (icon 3: shown in four locations) may in some embodiments precede compression (10), as shown.  (High pressure is indicated by twocompressor symbols.) CO.sub.2 processed in this modality typically is stored in one or more tanks, or in a farm or farms of such tanks (12) prior to export by one or more high-pressure pipelines (13) or by pressurized tank truck (14).  Distribution ofhigh pressure CO.sub.2 internally within the CO.sub.2-UH is shown by item 15 showing two uses: 15a and 15b.  Flow vector 15a represent transfer from pressure storage of CO.sub.2 into refrigeration processing into refrigerated liquefied CO.sub.2, whereasthe extension (15b) represents a transfer directly into refrigeration for dry ice production, if desired.  Flow vector 27 indicates that compressed CO.sub.2 may be supplied into outputs of process train 23.', 'In FIG. 3, the process train labeled 25 is refrigerated liquefied CO.sub.2 production, storage and disposition (18, 22, 39).  Storage is in one or more thermally insulated liquid CO.sub.2 tanks (17), or in a farm or farms of such tanks (17),prior to export by refrigerated tank trucks (18), or transfer by insulated pipeline (22) into dry ice production (process train 26), storage (20) and delivery (21).', 'In FIG. 3, flow vector 39 represents transfer of stored refrigerated liquid CO.sub.2 by insulated pipeline for recovery of cryo-energy.  One of the functions of the CO.sub.2-UH facility is storage of refrigerated liquid CO.sub.2 (17:""LCO.sub.2"") by means of refrigeration energy input.  This energy can be recovered such that storage of LCO.sub.2 acts as a battery.  For recovery of energy stored in this way, the cold liquid is transferred through an insulated pipeline (39) to a heatexchanger and turbine energy extraction system (represented by item 40).  Heat exchange with the atmosphere (preferably via the air intake of the ASU), or with powerplant exhaust, causes a phase-changing expansion of CO.sub.2.  This flow of expanding gasdrives a turbine generating electrical power for export into the grid, typically for load balancing purposes.  (An overview of this cryo-system for energy storage is provided in FIG. 6.) In some embodiments, this capacity for cryogenic energy storage inthe CO.sub.2-UH facility includes additional storage of liquefied N.sub.2 (31, ""LN2"") or liquefied O.sub.2 (30, ""LO2""), or both, as shown.  These additional capacities for LN.sub.2, LO.sub.2 and LCO.sub.2 handling for cryo-energy storage are described insubsequent sections.  They have the capacity to provide load-balancing services for three uses.  These uses are: (i) for energy storage internally to allow variable power output into the grid for the powerplant (OXFCPS); (ii) to provide energy storagecapacity for the grid, if desired; and (iii) to provide energy storage capacity to handle irregular renewable power inputs for CO.sub.2-UH production modes (such as ""solar fuels"" and/or ""wind fuels"" and/or ""hydro fuels"" production using CO.sub.2 as acarbon source), if desired.', 'The process train modality labeled 26 in FIG. 3 is dry ice production by refrigeration (19) of CO.sub.2 supplied by other process trains (15b, 22).  Dry ice is stored in an insulated storage warehouse (20) prior to delivery by truck (21),typically with thermal insulation storage and/or packaging.  In some embodiments, dry ice is used for cryogenic energy storage.  (Note that specific system linkages are not illustrated for this use).', 'In FIG. 3, the process train labeled 22 shows CO.sub.2 utilized for transformation of CO.sub.2 into CO.sub.2-containing products and/or more broadly for production utilizing CO.sub.2 in conditions that may require time-varying steps of CO.sub.2input in different conditions of temperature, pressure and steam and/or water vapor content according to production recipes.  This may occur within the CO.sub.2-UH defined within a local or semi-local geographical domain.  Process train 22 provides anexample of a type of CO.sub.2 utilization via a pressure chamber for carbonation.  Gas proceeds by a choice (28, typically determined and directed by means of a valve) for processing with or without, a dehydration step (3).  The gas flow proceeds thougha valve disposition subsystem (4).  This valve disposes flow to proceed without or with degrees of compression (10) into a processing chamber unit (5).  The unit shown (5) is meant to be representative of many different modalities of CO.sub.2 utilizationinvolving many different types of industrial CO.sub.2 use.  Simply for example, in FIG. 3 unit (5) is shown by icons representing a carbonation-reaction chamber appropriate for the carbonation of cementitious building materials.  After a suitable periodof carbonation, materials created in a processing unit (5) are stored and/or possibly cured under gas composition, temperature and humidity controls in a warehouse (6), before being purveyed by means of any appropriate mode of transportation, asrepresented in the figure symbolically by truck (7) and ship (8) icons.  Again, many other modalities of industrial processing for utilizing CO.sub.2 could be represented for this modality of CO.sub.2 utilization involving a process recipe of scheduledinputs with variability of composition and state.  The carbonation pressure chamber mode, as shown (5), is one example only.  It includes the main processing steps of gas preparation by purification and/or compression followed by one or more processes ofproduct manufacture utilizing CO.sub.2, a large number of which are referenced herein.', 'In FIG. 3, box 36 represents an integrative linkage of cryogenic capacities between the OXFCPS (not shown) and the two cryogenic process trains labeled 25 and 26.  This linkage exists in certain preferred embodiments.  A double-sided arrow (35)represents a capacity for flow in both directions between the ASU-OXFCPS complex (as shown in FIG. 2) and process train 25 for liquefied nitrogen and/or oxygen and/or carbon dioxide.  This linkage adds handling, storage and disposition of liquid oxygen(30, 32) and liquid nitrogen (31, 33) to process train 25, which otherwise is a process train with cryogenic capacities specialized only in the freezing, handling, storage and dispersal of liquefied CO.sub.2 (17, 18).  As shown by icons within box 29,the linkage also included the capacity to generate electric power by releasing cryo-energy by venting LN.sub.2 to the atmosphere or to various uses via a heat engine (33) and similarly via a heat engine by gasifying LO.sub.2 into the OXFCPS (32 via 35). An icon representing refrigeration within box 29 represents the capacity of the linkage (represented by box 36) to provide refrigeration into process trains 25 and 26, drawing from the cryogenic capabilities of the ASU (if the ASU is of the cryogenicmodality).  In certain preferred embodiments, the linkage (36, 29, 32) also gasifies stored liquefied oxygen (30) via a heat engine power generator (represented by icons within 29) connecting to the O.sub.2 intake supply for oxyfuel combustion (via 35). The linkage labeled as number 34 offers the possibility to contribute cryogenic cooling into the cryogenic capacity of the process train dedicated to produce dry ice (26).  Overall, in certain preferred embodiments, this integration (symbolized by box 29and box 36) connects (35) the CO.sub.2-UH to the Air Separation Unit (ASU) within the OXFCPS.  The linkage makes cryogenic cooling available to be used in the cryogenic process trains 25 and 26, specifically to the cooling units labeled 16 and 19. Further detail is provided in FIG. 6.', ""The linkage represented within box 36 plus items 39 and 40 establish a cryo-energy storage capability for the invention overall, connecting with the ASU-OXFCPS complex.  A capacity to store cryogenic energy is a method of storage for electricpower.  Cryogenic energy storage allows the capacity to vary the level of electricity export into the receiving grid while from the oxyfuel powerplant operates at a constant optimal rate of internal power production.  It can also provide additionalenergy storage grid services as noted above.  For natural gas oxyfuel turbines, a connected oxygen-supplying (14) ASU typically draws .about.10% of the powerplant's internal power production when operated continuously at a constant level of production ofoxygen.  The use of cryogenic energy storage is valuable to powerplant operations.  It allows diurnal modulation of power export output to be by up to a scale of a roughly 20% spread between high and low output to the grid with constant continuousinternal power production by the central turbine(s) system burning degassed Lake Kivu methane.  That is to say, a 20% spread would be the difference in power export to the grid for a daily cycle with 12 hours of ASU oxygen production on, followed by 12hours with ASU oxygen production off.  The operation of such a modality of energy storage is dependent upon the operational capacity of the ASU.  Operating by cryogenic energy storage in this 12-hours-on, 12-hours-off mode requires capacity to operatethe ASU at a level of production .about.2.times.  the rating for round-the-clock continuous oxygen production.  As noted above, additional cryo-energy storage may be obtained by operating separate power-generating heat engine turbines utilizingcryo-energy stored in insulated reservoirs of liquefied nitrogen and oxygen (as shown in FIG. 3, items 30 and 31).  LCO.sub.2 also may be used in cryogenic energy storage (17, 39, 40).  The method and system of these cryo-energy-tapping heat engineturbines and their heat exchangers are represented by two icons placed in the upper sector of Box 29 shown in FIG. 3.  (The system of item 40 recovering cryo-energy stored in LCO.sub.2 is not shown extensively in FIG. 3.  It is shown in FIG. 6.) This boxrepresents a part of the interconnections between the ASU (as shown in FIG. 2: item 27) and the component of the CO.sub.2-UH identified by item 30 in FIG. 2.  (In FIG. 2, these connections are labeled 33 for LN.sub.2, 32 for LO.sub.2 and 41 and 40 forLCO.sub.2).  Generalized sales/delivery of LO.sub.2 and LN.sub.2 is shown by pipeline icons (37 and 38).  Flow vector 34 shows interconnection of cryogenic systems storing LCO.sub.2 with dry ice storage and manufacture (the process train labeled 26)."", 'FIG. 4 represents the invention disclosed herein as a method and system for industrializing economic development.  According to the invention, Lake Kivu deepwater processing creates a multiplicity of outputs that can be described by economicmetrics.  Such economic metrics are causally linked to the product flows shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 as measures of economic output.  Shown on the left side of the diagram are extracted (1) Lake Kivu deepwater (12) resource flows (labeled: 3, 4, 5, 6, andaltogether: 2).  These, variously in the middle of the diagram (9, 10, 11), are shown inputting CO.sub.2 (that would otherwise be waste) into a productive, jobs-creating, CO.sub.2 utilization Hub (7, illustrated with exemplary, non-limiting icons), whilesimultaneously efficiently combusting methane (6) to produce power (9) in an optimal manner with efficient carbon capture (10).  Lake Kivu deepwater (12) contains (Box 2) several types of useful resources (sub-boxes: 3, 4, 5, 6).  Lake Kivu\'s deepwateris extracted (1) with its dissolved resources flowing into separation operations (Box 2, which encloses Boxes 3, 4, 5 and 6).  Each sub-box represents different types of utilizable substances, as noted.  All can be directed into useful industrialproduction.  The invention disclosed herein pertains primarily to the utilization of methane (Box 6) and CO.sub.2 (Box 3), both degassed from Lake Kivu deepwater via transformation into a stream of CO.sub.2 and steam exhaust entering a CO.sub.2-UH (item7), whereby the submethods and subsystems of oxyfuel combustion, or MSDS in the variant form of the invention (both as described herein but not shown in FIG. 4) provides means for transformation.  The flux of CO.sub.2 from degassing (11) joins togetherwith a flow of CO.sub.2 produced (10) by methane combustion (9) in the TDS modality.  This provides (as represented by transfer vector 10) a material basis for CO.sub.2 utilization in a CO.sub.2 utilization hub (CO.sub.2-UH, item 7).  As indicated byrepresentative icons, the CO.sub.2-UH (7) creates jobs, industrial production, and consequent economic growth (item 8).  Note that dissolved magnesium (Mg) may be co-utilized with CO.sub.2 in the production of materials containing Mg-carbonates.  Also,ammonium ion (NH.sub.4.sup.+) may be co-utilized with CO.sub.2 both in the production of urea as well as in the nutrient fertilization of algal biocultures which may co-fertilized with CO.sub.2.  These resources are identified together in Box 5 labeled""other substances."" Utilizations of dissolved magnesium and/or NH.sub.4.sup.+ are, however, optional features of the invention disclosed herein.  The utilization of dissolved magnesium is described in an independent disclosure by the inventor in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1.', 'FIG. 5 illustrates and summarizes several benefits of the invention disclosed herein, shown in Box 2, in comparison with existing (circa 2016) technology shown in box 1.  The figure highlights aspects whereby the invention offers substantialcontributions to power production efficiency, lake safety, environmental stewardship and economic development.  The invention is indicated in Box 2 only its TDS-based modality.  TDS refers to the method of a Total Degassing System.  The MSDS (ModifiedStaged Degassing System) variant is not shown in FIG. 5.  (FIG. 8 provides details.) Black vectors illustrate CO.sub.2 flux through systems.  (Except for vector 24 which represents flow of near-surface water.) These, in comparison, highlight theCO.sub.2-utilizing aspect of the invention via a CO.sub.2 Utilization Hub (16).  The existing technology practiced on Lake Kivu utilizes the method of staged degassing"" (SDS) for gas extraction and cleaning prior to combustion.  As illustrated (Box 1),the SDS method proceeds in (minimally) two stages.  A first stage of separation is enclosed by a dashed oval (22).  Item 22 is a gas-water separator.  It is located at a specified depth corresponding to a useful pressure for fractionation to optimize theCH.sub.4/CO.sub.2 ratio and minimize CH.sub.4 retention losses in solution through the degassing process.  Typically the preferred depth is .about.20 meters.  A substantial fraction (.about.>20%) of methane remains in solution and is returned to thedeep lake (19) in the return flow of water (31) which also contains .about.80% of the initial concentration of CO.sub.2 (5).  A second stage (25) utilizes scrubbing with water to absorb CO.sub.2.  The process uses near-surface water that is not saturatedin CO.sub.2.  The scrubbing process acts by gas-water equilibrium between gas bubbles and/or gas flow of stage-1 interacting/equilibrating with CO.sub.2-undersaturated near-surface water.  Gas bubbles and/or flows upwards through a platform-supported (4,icon 12a) scrubbing device (25).  This process preferentially resorbs CO.sub.2 (with respect to CH.sub.4) back into solution.  Some methane is absorbed into solution in stage-2 and plumbed back into the lake (20).  Hence methane is lost in both stages sothat the flux of methane piped (7) into conventional piston engines (8) is substantially reduced.  This ""slip"" wastage is shown for both stages: 19 and 20.  One aspect of the comparison shows that utilization of CO.sub.2 in a CO.sub.2-UH (16) creates abasis for large-scale industrial development (16, 21), represented by icons.  Another aspect is securing lake safety against limnic eruption such as may be triggered by sub lacustrine volcanism or other types of triggering phenomena.  Lake Kivu\'s maindensity discontinuity is presently located at .about.260 meters depth.  It is represented by a dashed horizontal line (17).  CO.sub.2 flux is represented with black vectors in both boxes in the figure (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 25).  CH.sub.4 flux isrepresented with stippled vectors in both boxes in the figure (3, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23).  Water flux is shown as flow vector 3-to-31 in box 1.  In Box 2, water flux is shown as flow via a deepwater inlet (10) to intake (26) into a gas-water separator (27). Water flow proceeds out of the separator via directed flow (28) into de-densifying water treatment (29).  Flow then continues back into the lake (30) where it is released well above the main density discontinuity (17).  The de-densifying water treatmentmethod and system (29) have been disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1.', 'In Box 2 (which represents the invention) of FIG. 5, utilization of CO.sub.2 is facilitated by an initial process of total degassing.  This is via a total degassing system, TDS (27), hosted in a floating structure (11), linked with an iconrepresenting a water-borne platform (12b).  Return flow in the TDS-based method, as noted above, does not return CO.sub.2 and CH.sub.4 into the lake.  By contrast, in the SDC-method (Box 1), most of the CO.sub.2 flowing upwards into the intake (3) isreturned into Lake Kivu (5, 6).  Most is being returned (5) into to the gas-rich deepwater reservoir existing below the main density discontinuity (17).  Such a situation preserves and extends a dangerous condition due to limnic eruption catastrophehazard.  In Box 2 (representing the invention), return flow can be de-densified (in item 29) such that it can be reinjected into the lake above the main density discontinuity (30).  This increases lake safety.  It does so by drawing down the volume ofthe gas-rich deep layer.  This drawing down ""deflation"" is illustrated in Box 2 as a time transition.  It is shown by small downward arrows illustrating movement of line 17 to a later situation identified by line 18.', 'FIG. 5 illustrates a key factor of inefficiency in the standard (SDS-based) method.  This is the loss or ""slip"" of methane shown as vectors 19 and 20.  Methane returned via stage-2 into Lake Kivu\'s bio-zone upper layer (20) is irrevocably lostby biological capture and metabolism, typically by bacteria.  Methane ""slip"" lost into the lake\'s deeper resource zone (19) remains extractable in principle.  However, in practice, this methane is not extractable.  This is for two reasons.  First, returnof this ""slip"" methane into the deep layer is associated with dilution of the methane concentration in the deepwater reservoir over time.  Dilution increases extraction inefficiency.  Late in the extraction, inefficiency increases drastically. Effectively this means that the returned methane is lost.  Second, some actual operations are not returning the flow (indicated as 31, 5, 19) into the deep lake below the main density discontinuity (17).  Water is being mixed with near surface water andreinjected at a higher level in a depth range where it is not extractable by the SDS method.  Mixing-in near-surface water also oxygenates the flow such that methane is lost by bacterial uptake.  Direct methane losses in the SDS-based method are roughlyone third.  Indirect methane losses via the effect of dilution of the deep layer add additional degrees of inefficiency.', 'Overall, the invention disclosed herein and in the related disclosures of U.S.  Patent Application Publications Nos.  20150354451 A1 and 20160257577 A1 creates an efficiency gain of approximately .times.2.4 in terms of total power produced by anOXFCPS (13) from the lake in comparison to the SDS-based method.  The use of supercritical CO.sub.2 power cycle technology can increase this factor to .about..times.3.0.', 'FIG. 6 illustrates special cryogenic aspects of the invention.  These aspects are diverse and powerfully versatile.  They include cryo-energy storage (23, 24, 25, 28) and recovery (3, 18, 29, 30), as well as provision of coolant flows of liquid(11) and/or cold (12) nitrogen to a Digital Data Center (5, DDC).  Cryogenic aspects also include capacities for powerplant (1, 33) temporal load-balancing (18), provision of grid balancing services (15, 16), utilization of remote solar and/or wind power(20) inputs (21), and production and utilization of LNG (36, see below) and other forms of NG (40), such as CNG and ANG.  Irregular solar and wind power inputs may be stored and used in power-absorbing modes of production within the CO.sub.2-UH (Box 4),for example production of H.sub.2, O.sub.2 and ""solar chemicals,"" including carbon-recycling, hydrogen-binding ""solar fuels"" such as methanol and/or DME.  FIG. 6 illustrates detail that is not provided in Box 5 shown in FIG. 1.  Cryogenic aspects of theinvention are illustrated in all modalities based upon the three different available gases: N.sub.2, O.sub.2 and CO.sub.2.  These are all present in preferred embodiments of the invention, as is any subset using only one or only two of these gases.  Aparticular utilization of nitrogen gas also is shown.  It is for cooling of a Digital Data Center (DDC, 5).  Cryogenic equipment for air separation and other gas cooling tasks exists within an Air Separation Unit (2).  This unit is shown functioning withexpanded capacities as a CRyogenic Processing Unit (2, ASU-CRPU).  This expanded capacity may be shared with the CO.sub.2-UH (box 4), as shown (via same number labeling of the cryo-production icons: 27a and 27b, however not represented spatially inconnection in the figure).  Or separate cryogenic facilities may exist within the CO.sub.2-UH (Box 4) supplied with power (17, 19) from the powerplant (icon in Box 1) and/or from the grid (15, 33), if desired.  Open arrows with single ends (such as, forexample, 6 through 13) represent matter flows.  Solid black arrows represent flows of electric power.  (Power may be mechanically transmitted and/or more typically transmitted by wires as electric power.  Of course power is supplied into (16) the grid(33).) Two double-ended arrows appear within Box 22 (CESSI).  These connect to heat exchanger icons labeled 29 and 30.  They represent options of connectivity shared by a CRyo-Energy Recovery Unit (Box 3: CRERU), which is adjunct to both the AirSeparation Unit (ASU, Box 2) and the OXyFuel Combustion Power System (Box 1, OXFCPS).  These options of connectivity of the CRERU (Box 3) connect cryogenic heat engine power generator systems (shown within Box 22) with the heat sources of the air intake(14) of the Air Separation Unit\'s CRyo-Production Unit (Box 2: ASU-CRPU), and/or with the CO.sub.2 and water vapor exhaust (32) of the OXyFuel Combustion Power System (Box 1: OXFCPS).  Again, these connections are symbolized by heat exchanger icons 29and 30, respectively, linked to the center of Box 22 (CESSI) by the double-ended arrows.  The power generator systems are symbolized by icons shown in the inner part of Box 22 (CESSI) within the CRERU (Box 3).  These icons are shown as three pairs.  Theyillustrate power sources connecting to power transmission wires (18a, 18b and 18c).  These power sources tapping stored cryo-energy provide recovered stored power (18) into a nexus of electrical power regulation and disposition (dashed Box 41) connectingthe powerplant (Box 1) to the grid (33, 15, 16).  These systems (18a, 18b, 18c) extract stored cryo-energy, respectively, from flows of stored (25) refrigerated liquid CO.sub.2 (9, LCO.sub.2), stored (23) liquid oxygen (6, 10, LO.sub.2), and stored (24)liquid N.sub.2 (7, 11, LN.sub.2).  Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) also optionally is stored (34) within the CO.sub.2-UH (Box 4).  LNG provides very high efficiency cryo-energy storage with efficiencies above 90% for round trip energy storage.  LNG also ofcourse provides efficient storage of chemical energy that can be transported as well as sold in various forms, LNG, CNG and ANG (40).  Inclusion of cryogenic capacities for LNG production additionally provides the basis for a method and/or system for LNGproduction via cryo-separation of methane from carbon dioxide, (with CO.sub.2 separating in the form of dry ice according to elegant methods patented and demonstrated by Larry Baxter and colleagues).  Dashed Box 36 indicates a specialized domain for suchLNG-based operations, possessing LNG-specialized cryo-capacities (35) with CO.sub.2 separation capacity.  This domain (35) intakes a mixed gas inflow (37), degassed from a Lake Kivu deepwater source (38).  It produces outflows of separated solidifiedand/or liquified CO.sub.2 (39) and LNG (40).  LNG cryo-energy production and storage therefore also serves as a mode of CO.sub.2 processing appropriate as a valuable capacity of a CO.sub.2-UH for the production of dry ice and/or LCO.sub.2 as well as forcryo-energy storage.  Storage of cryogenic liquids is provided within a cryo-storage domain (28) within the CO.sub.2-UH (Box 4).  This domain (within dashed Box 28) functions both for liquefied gases storage generally as well as in the capacity of apower-storage battery as indicated by an icon (26).  Cryogenic energy storage systems can possess attractively high round trip efficiency and flexibility, as has been well demonstrated.  As shown by the icons, heat engine power generator systems (withinBox 22, CESSI) are comprised of heat exchange equipment combined with gas flow turbine generators.  The Air Separation Unit (2, ASU-CRPU) produces liquid oxygen (6: LO.sub.2) and liquid nitrogen (7: LN.sub.2) for energy storage as well as O.sub.2 gas fordirect intake into combustion in the OXFCPS (1).  After passing through heat exchangers linked to power generating turbines, gas flows are distributed as follows.  Cold nitrogen gas (12) is distributed as a cooling flow (to 5: a Digital Data Center, DDC,or other facility requiring large cooling flows), and may be otherwise directed (13) for additional uses after serving its function.  Warmed-up nitrogen (13) exiting the DDC (5) may be utilized for various purposes.  Oxygen gas (31) is fed into oxyfuelcombustion (1).  Carbon dioxide gas (8) is returned to the CO.sub.2-UH for disposition for utilization (4).', 'Such cryo-processing and cryo-energy storage capabilities are expanded and used, if desired, for load balancing of solar power (20) and/or wind power and/or hydropower inputs (21) flowing into the electricity handling nexus (Box 41) of thepowerplant (Box 1), or some adjunct electrical facility if/as needed.  Cryogenic energy storage capabilities present in some preferred embodiments thereby allow power storage as well as utilization of inputs (21) of solar and/or other sources ofrenewable power (20) plus CO.sub.2 within the CO.sub.2-UH (4) for production of ""solar chemicals,"" including ""solar fuels."" Efficiency factors are reported within research reports incorporated into this disclosure.  The development of such capabilitiesfor solar power utilization in support of CO.sub.2 utilization is very highly desirable.  This is from the perspective of the global need for economically useful innovations in the development of solar and/or other renewable sources of power, forexample, demonstrating economically viable large-scale cases of ""artificial photosynthesis"" based upon solar power inputs.  The invention offers this possibility utilizing carbon dioxide both as a cryo-energy storage liquid and as a carbon source.', 'FIG. 7 introduces a perspective of the invention as a collaboration and talent attractor.  This perspective is based upon the international strategic significance of large scale CO.sub.2 utilization combined with national economic development ina region that has suffered massive catastrophes and that also is extraordinarily beautiful as well as subject to a pleasantly attractive climate year round.  FIG. 7 shows a preferred embodiment of the invention in its aspect being an open hub attractingthe development of a global network.  The focus of the invention is the internationally strategic goal to create commercially viable new examples of very large scale CO.sub.2 utilization.  The NRG Cosia carbon X-Prize competition(http://carbon.xprize.org) exemplifies this situation.  The invention creates an opportunity to attract talent, capital, interest, publicity, and innovative new ideas and technologies.  The CO.sub.2-UH (Box 1), representing the invention overall,provides a global focus hub for the growth of an international network represented by the large peripheral circle (2) and its connected box (""Box"") containing a group of icons representing several different modalities of collaboration.  This networkstructures collaborations with companies, research institutions, financing institutions, non-profit funders and philanthropic agendas.  Each collaboration is represented by a spoke (double-ended arrow) connecting to a numbered ball situated on thenetwork circle.  There is no closed number of collaborations.  (Each collaboration is represented by a ball and spoke combination: 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) This openness is shown by the "" .  . . "" following the number identifying the twelfthball-and-spoke.  Components of the hub work in concert on the challenge of creating business-scalable innovations in carbon utilization recycling.  The icons inside the dashed box represent the multiple aspects of the network: research, training,e-platformed networking and knowledge dissemination, for-profit business and non-profit charitable involvements, new ventures formation, technology pilot projects, networked brainstorming, etc. The hub-structured open aspect of the CO.sub.2-UH (1)creates an intrinsic attractiveness with an open modularity for adding and developing specific modalities of CO.sub.2 utilization within a common framework.', 'FIG. 8 shows a system, method and apparatus concept that modifies the standard ""staged"" gas extraction technology presently utilized on Lake Kivu (Box 1: SDS), as shown by items 13 and 14 in FIG. 1.  The modification is into a system, method andapparatus concept (Box 2) possessing the capability to degas CO.sub.2 in a flow sequence following after stages 1 and 2.  This method and system of modification makes it possible to create a CO.sub.2-UH connected to an existing conventional staged gasextracting and powerplant operation/apparatus.  This type of modification, and/or method, and/or system is an embodiment of the invention.  This method and system of modification also makes it possible to design and develop a staged extraction powerplantsystem that degasses CO.sub.2 and therefore that can be constructed with addition of a CO.sub.2-UH.  The present disclosure is a method and system that links a CO.sub.2-UH to a Lake Kivu deepwater degassing system.  The latter may be either of both knowntypes: (i) a modification (MSDS) of the conventional ""staged"" degassing technology; or (ii) a ""total degassing technology"" (TDS).  Both types of degassing system (MSDS & TDS) are variant sub-components of the invention.  Both can connect to aCO.sub.2-UH, as shown in FIG. 1.  Both can connect to return flow systems as shown in Box 3 of FIG. 8.', 'FIG. 8, Box 1 illustrates the conventional staged method (SDS) as follows.  Deepwater enters a riser system (1) via auto-siphoning flow, and/or with pumping assistance.  Flowing upwards, it enters a degassing system (1, 2).  Degassed gas iscollected at a depth (10) below the surface of Lake Kivu indicated as ""D."" This depth typically is selected to optimize both CH.sub.4 yield and the CH.sub.4/CO.sub.2 ratio in a situation of a divergence of two factors: (i) maximizing the degree ofmethane extraction by degassing (which increases with decreasing D); and (ii) minimizing the degree of CO.sub.2 extraction by degassing (which also increases with decreasing D).  Gas obtained by stage-1 degassing is separated from the deepwater flow (2,9a) and directed to flow upward (3) in a contained gas transfer riser system.  In some designs, this gas enters into a 2.sup.nd stage gas-cleaning process positioned near to the lake\'s surface.  (Some designs clean gas in a 2.sup.nd stage below thesurface.  Others clean gas above the surface in bubble or trickle towers.) As shown, the gas-cleaning process utilizes near surface water (5, 6, 7).  This water is pumped (5) upwards (6) and released downwards to flow downwards inside a bubble or trickletower (4), then out of it (7) and back into the lake.  This method and system absorbs and removes CO.sub.2 preferentially from the gas flow (3).  Cleaned gas is collected and extracted at the top of the chamber by exit flow (8, which may be pumped insome embodiments) at the completion of the gas-cleaning process.  It is then provided by pipeline into combustion (not shown).  The 2.sup.nd-stage ""water washing"" method is designed to minimize methane ""slip"" loss and maximize the CH.sub.4/CO.sub.2 ratioof the gas exiting the overall multi-stage system (8).  However, methane slip from both stages may be as high or higher than 30%, whereas power output utilization for the water pumping process (5) may be as high higher than 12% of total power output. For this and other reasons, the standard staged method and system shown in FIG. 8, Box 1 is only 1/2 to 1/3rd as efficient in power production efficiency relative to the ""total degassing oxyfuel combustion"" method and system disclosed in US 2015/0354451. Despite these limitations, it may be modified as shown in Box 2 to degas CO.sub.2 for utilization and in order to degas the deep lake to increase lake safety.  Bow tie symbols represent flow valves.  If flow is directed away from conventional return flow(9b) and into a diversion line (11), then the redirected flow auto siphons into a degassing chamber (12).  This process degasses a substantial fraction of degassable CO.sub.2 into the gas phase as an extraction flow (14).  (The remainder remains insolution.) Thus, a conventional Staged Degassing System (SDS, Box 1) is modifiable, as shown, into a modified system that degasses a substantial faction of CO.sub.2 (MSDS, Box 2, with or without the additional modifications shown in Box 3).  The CO.sub.2degasser separates a flow of CO.sub.2 gas (14) out of solution in the return flow (11).  The resulting doubly degassed return flow may be injected into the deep lake in the conventional manner (13).  Otherwise it may be diverted into additionalmodifications as shown in Box 3.', 'Box 3 within Box 2 shows how a MSDS can connect by additional modification into submethods and subsystems for organizing deepwater return flow as have been disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1. The method and system and apparatus design concept illustrated within Box 2 is applicable to both types of deepwater degassing method and system: staged degassing as shown in FIG. 8, and the total degassing,"" as disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  PatentApplication Publication No. 20150354451 A1.  As specified in FIG. 1 and in FIG. 2, Box 1, the invention does not include a return flow system in its most basic form of definition.  However, certain preferred embodiments connect ""main modes"" of CO.sub.2utilization in the CO.sub.2-UH connect into types of return flow system.  Therefore these modalities and the return flow systems they connect into are described in the following sections.', 'Three non-exclusive options are shown within Boxes 2 and 3 of FIG. 8 for the fully degassed return flow of deepwater.  These are: (i) conventional deep reinjection (13), identical to that shown as 9a and 9b; (ii) admixing into the biozone ofLake Kivu (15) as a means of fertilization to boost ecosystem output; and (iii) return flow with inclusion of de-densifying water treatment by algal growth (18) and mineral precipitation (19), thereby allowing reinjection of the de-densified return flowinto the Intermediate Zone (IZ) of Lake Kivu, (as disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1).', 'FIG. 8, Box 3 shows various different modalities for CO.sub.2 utilization in the context of the return flow options shown.  Two of these involve CO.sub.2 injection diffusers into the return flow.  These diffusers are indicated as 28 and 26. Item 28 represents a diffuser for CO.sub.2 input (27 into 28) into a component of return flow directed into Lake Kivu\'s biozone (0 to .about.80 meters depth) for biozone fertilization (as shown in item 15, a diffuser).  This flux of CO.sub.2 correspondsto CO.sub.2 injection vector 2b in FIG. 2.  (Vector 2a in FIG. 2 represents a CO.sub.2 diffusion system separate from that for nutrient-rich return flow water.) CO.sub.2 diffusion into Lake Kivu\'s biozone via flux (27) released into diffuser(s) (28)corresponds to mode 2 in Table 1.  Item 26 represents a pH-balancing diffuser.  It diffuses CO.sub.2 input (25) into the flows of de-densified return flow reinjected into Lake Kivu.  This is for (optional) ""recarbonation"" to conversion of carbonateanions to bicarbonate anions associated with sodium and potassium.  This flux of CO.sub.2 (25 via 26) corresponds to CO.sub.2 injection vector 3 in FIG. 2.  It also corresponds to mode 3 in Table 1.', 'FIG. 8, Box 3 includes a 3rd additional modality for CO.sub.2 utilization by diffusion into return flow.  This is in a surface flow (16) method and system for return flow water treatment (18, 19) prior to reinjection into Lake Kivu (26, 20). This method and system of de-densifying water treatment is disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1.  CO.sub.2 utilizing inputs are shown in FIG. 8 for pH control (21a, 22).  Related CO.sub.2 inputs alsoprovide carbon feeding for algal biomass growth in a biological water treatment system method (21a into 17a, and 22 into 18).  Items 17a and 17b represent different possible modalities.  These correspond, respectively, to CO.sub.2 flux into (17a) andCO.sub.2 flux out of (17b) the flow, as shown by the double arrow (21a,b).  These different modalities are: (i) first, CO.sub.2 injection into the flow (21a, 17a) representing a pH-controlling submethod and subsystem for avoiding mineral precipitation;and (ii) second, CO.sub.2 removal out of the flow (17b, 21b).  The latter modality is not described herein.  It only is illustrated as an option included in some embodiments.', 'In FIG. 8, item 18 in Box 3 represents a photosynthetic method and/or system for growing algae within the return flow over an extended period of time.  Arrows 21b, 23 and 24 represent CO.sub.2 removal as a means of pH-raising associated withprocesses for precipitation of Mg and Ca.  Arrows 21a and 22 represent CO.sub.2 input into a photosynthetic method and system for growing algae in the return flow over an extended period of time.  CO.sub.2 input provides carbon for photosynthesis.  Itsphotosynthetic utilization raises pH.  Arrows (21 a and 22) represent a method and system of pH control by provision of CO.sub.2 for algal carbon source supply and in order to suppress high-pH conditions such as would precipitate magnesium and calcium. Flux of CO.sub.2 into the bioculture method and system (21a and 22 into 17b and 18) corresponds to CO.sub.2 injection vector 4 in FIG. 2.  It also corresponds to mode 4 in Table 1.', 'FIG. 9 is quasi-identical to FIG. 1.  The labeling in FIG. 9 is identical to that in FIG. 1 excepting that additional detail has been provided within dashed Box 4.  Therefore the labeling is not repeated in this section, except for items withinbox 4.  For other items, refer to the items list and to sections discussing FIG. 1.  The focus of FIG. 9 Box 4 is upon illuminating distinct modes in the utilization of CO.sub.2 ""going back"" to be used within Lake Kivu (9 a,b,c) for several differentpurposes.  Some modes of CO.sub.2 utilization into Lake Kivu (15c, 15d, place CO.sub.2 into the biozone (9a) for use in C-fertilizing aquatic photosynthesis.  Mode 15d does this by injection of CO.sub.2 into return flow diffused into the biozone (7a) asa C-fertilizing flux (as shown in FIG. 8, item 15).  Mode 15c does this by direct diffusion into the biozone without connection with admixture of return flow water.  Mode 15e places CO.sub.2 into the Intermediate Zone (9b) in a context of pH-balancing ofde-densified return flow (18) that has become high in pH via bioproduction (16) followed by harvesting and mineral precipitation processes (17).  Injecting CO.sub.2 into this return flow (18) after completion of de-densifying processes (16, 17)transforms its alkaline chemistry rich in (Na- and K-complexed) carbonate anions at high-pH into bicarbonate anions at a lesser pH.  The flux of CO.sub.2 labeled 15a injected into return flow (7) flowing out of the Total Degassing System (Box 1) is forpurposes of acidification, if and as needed, to avoid and/or control precipitation of Mg and Ca in this flow.  The flux of CO.sub.2 labeled 15b is provided as a carbon source into photosynthesis in (typically floating) algal growth operations (16)positioned on the surface of Lake Kivu but not communicating with it.  The open arrow labeled 19 represents extractive flows from algal harvesting and from the capture of Ma and Ca precipitates.', 'Twenty ""main mode"" selected examples of CO.sub.2 utilization are described in following.  These correspond to CO.sub.2 flux vectors labeled 1 through 20 shown in FIG. 2.  These represent product flows (FIG. 2, Box 8) exiting the CO.sub.2-UH(FIG. 2, Box 21).  Use of CO.sub.2 for cryo-energy storage is not included in this list of ""main modes"" because it mainly is not a mode whereby CO.sub.2 flows out of the CO.sub.2-UH (21) as a product stream.  The first seven of the twenty ""main modes""all are CO.sub.2 flows.  The eighth mode is a transitional type.  It represents a modality of CO.sub.2 flow connecting into a building materials production flow based upon absorption of CO.sub.2 flow and hydration into cementitious carbonatingmineralization.  The eighth mode (FIG. 2, arrow or vector 8) represents a time-varying and properties-varying flow of CO.sub.2 input corresponding to a production recipe.  CO.sub.2 products of the CO.sub.2-UH are represented in FIG. 2 by arrows orvectors 1 through 7, and transitionally by arrow or vector 8.  All provide flows of CO.sub.2, with or without associated steam, with or without a high degree of compression, and with or without cryo-preparation to states of liquid CO.sub.2 and dry ice. Such product flows of CO.sub.2 can be categorized into five types.  (NB: ""Types"" of CO.sub.2 flows are different from ""main modes"" of CO.sub.2 utilization.) Each type corresponds to a different process train shown in FIG. 3 (22, 23, 24, 25, 26).  Theyare as follows.  The first type of flow corresponds to process train 23 in FIG. 3.  It is relatively ""raw"" CO.sub.2 exhaust gas.  The flow is not dehydrated or compressed to high pressure for long-distance pipeline transport.  It is compressed only, ifand as needed, to pressures sufficient for local pipeline transport.  In FIG. 2, vectors 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4 and 5, (the last having to do with local algal biomass feeding), are CO.sub.2 flows of this type.  The second type of CO.sub.2 flow is CO.sub.2exhaust gas that has been dehydrated and compressed to pressures that are sufficient for long-distance pipeline transport.  This flow is directed into pipeline transport as needed.  It corresponds to process train 24 in FIG. 3.  In FIG. 2, arrow orvector 6, and sometimes arrow or vector 5 (having to do with algal biomass carbon source feeding, when the CO.sub.2 transport distance is large), are CO.sub.2 flows of this second type.  The third type of CO.sub.2 flow is refrigerated CO.sub.2 in theform of liquefied CO.sub.2.  This type corresponds to process train 25 in FIG. 3.  In FIG. 2, vector 7 includes liquefied CO.sub.2.  The fourth type of CO.sub.2 flow is of frozen CO.sub.2 ""dry ice."" This type of flow corresponds to process train 26 inFIG. 3.  In FIG. 2, arrow or vector 7 includes solidified CO.sub.2.  The fifth type of CO.sub.2 flow is a flow with properties that vary in time according to a product production recipe.  It corresponds to process train labeled 22 in FIG. 3.  Processtrain 22 is drawn to display the specific case of cement-based eco-concretes and building materials involving cementitious carbonation and hydration.  This is as an example appropriate to display in time-varying production flow with changing properties. In FIG. 2, arrow or vector 8 corresponds to this specific option.  In the case of eco-concrete and related building materials, it represents a transitional situation from a CO.sub.2 product (delivery of a CO.sub.2 and steam flow according to atime-varying recipe) to a product created by utilizing CO.sub.2.  However, this type of CO.sub.2 flow is not limited only to production of eco-concretes and related building materials.  Other products may require time-varying recipes for the input ofCO.sub.2 with or without associated steam, and at various pressures and temperatures, for example involving pressure-temperature-gas-composition variation schedules.  The remaining arrows or vectors, 9 through 20, represent additional ""main modes"" ofCO.sub.2 utilization.  In these, CO.sub.2 is used as an input ingredient or otherwise as a processing substance utilized for production of products within the domain of the CO.sub.2-UH (FIG. 2, 21), shown in FIG. 2.', 'The first ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization (FIG. 2, arrow 1) is CO.sub.2 fertilization in greenhouse horticulture for plant growth acceleration and yield boosting.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  In FIG. 2,arrow 1 is shown for this use locally.  Unprocessed gas may be used for this purpose.  Modest compression only is needed for distribution via a local network of pipes.  If an areal extent of 5,000 hectares (a square area, 5 km.times.10 km) is chosen,then the approximate CO.sub.2 utilization will be .about.2 MTA CO.sub.2 (based on calculations given herein).  The amount of CO.sub.2 utilization scales roughly as the area of greenhouse horticulture using CO.sub.2.  The provision of large amounts ofCO.sub.2 for use in distant greenhouse horticulture on a large scale requires dehydration and pressurization of CO.sub.2 for long-distance pipeline transportation.', 'The second ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is Lake Kivu biozone fertilization.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  It is represented as flow arrow 2 in FIG. 2.  This vector split into two sub-vectors, 2a and 2b. This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization requires only unprocessed gas (as shown in the process train labeled 23 in FIG. 3).  It is approximately pure CO.sub.2, except with no need for it to be dehydrated or highly pressurized.  The CO.sub.2 is injected intoLake Kivu in two ways.  First, it can be disseminated by a system of diffusers directly into the biozone of the Lake.  This is shown in FIG. 2 as vector 2a.  Second, it can be disseminated into a return flow of degassed deepwater diffused into thebiozone of Lake Kivu as a nutrient source.  This is shown in FIG. 2 as vector 2b, (with CO.sub.2 dissolving into the return flow water disseminated into the biozone shown as vector 2b connecting into the return water flow vector labeled number 36c). Doing so under ecosystem feedback monitoring and control boosts the lake\'s biological productivity and fish yield.  Inventive details will be disclosed elsewhere.  An estimate for an appropriate scale of CO.sub.2 utilization for diffusion into LakeKivu\'s biozone is as follows.  The natural scale of deepwater upflux from Lake Kivu\'s Main Resource Zone (MRZ) has been roughly estimated to be .about.0.15 km.sup.3/yr across an areal extent of .about.1000 km.sup.2 by Schmid and Wuest, (2012).  This fluxcorresponds to an influx volume from deep springs emitting CO.sub.2-rich high-density water into the MRZ.  It provides a minimum determination of natural CO.sub.2 flux into the base of the biozone.  Using the CO.sub.2 concentration reported in Table 1(from Wuest et al., 2012), this determines a CO.sub.2 upflux of .about.0.5 MTA (million tonnes per year).  A more precise estimate has been obtained from NH.sub.4.sup.+ data in the analysis of Pasche et al., (2011, 2012).  Pasche\'s analysis determines anupflux of .about.0.7 MTA CO.sub.2.  This natural upward flux of CO.sub.2 nutrient from below into Lake Kivu\'s biozone is shut-off or diluted by some return flow injection schemes.  In such circumstances, the upward flux of CO.sub.2 into the biozone canbe replaced by artificial diffusion into the return flow flux being reinjected into the lake.  In general, increasing the CO.sub.2 flux from below boosts the ecological productivity of the lake.  It acts as a carbon source for algal photosynthesis. Pending input-response testing in test areas in the lake, a scientifically informed rough estimate for a reasonable boost is at least a factor-of-three increase.  This indicates a target delivery at least .about.2 MTA of CO.sub.2 into the biozone.', 'The third ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization (FIG. 2, arrow 3) is diffusion-dissolution of CO.sub.2 into high-pH (pH >10) return flow water following water treatment processing by pH-raising methods.  This mode of utilization of CO.sub.2relates the return flow water treatment process disclosed in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1.  This disclosure presents a method for treating nutrient-rich dense deepwater from Lake Kivu in such a way that the outflow of theprocess yields a de-densified water at a high pH.  Addition of CO.sub.2 by injective dissolution may be used to treat this water for purposes of pH reduction prior to reinjection into Lake Kivu at a depth level below the biozone, most desirably withinthe so-called Intermediate Zone (IZ).  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization for pH reduction of high-pH return flow treated water is a preferred embodiment.  It is shown in FIG. 2 as CO.sub.2 flow vector 3 connecting into return water flow vector 36b. Sourcing for this CO.sub.2 in the CO.sub.2-UH is shown in FIG. 3 as process train 23.  This offers an opportunity to sequester CO.sub.2 in Lake Kivu in a non-dangerous situation more than 100 meters above the .about.260 meter deep main densitydiscontinuity.  Utilizing CO.sub.2 for pH-balancing may be ecologically prudent even though the injection level is under the biozone rather than within it.  Lowering of pH involves dissolving CO.sub.2 into alkaline solution causing transformation ofdoubly charged carbonate anions, each associated with two sodium cations, into singly charged bicarbonate anions, each associated with one sodium cation.  The scale of CO.sub.2 utilization via this modality depends on the sodium concentration and thetotal flow of return flow water processed according to the bio-treatment and Mg+Ca-precipitation method.  A simple rough estimate is to assume that CO.sub.2 absorption into the high pH solution will convert all sodium-associated ions(2Na.sup.+::1CO.sub.3.sup.2-) into sodium-associated bicarbonate ions (2Na.sup.+::2HCO.sub.3.sup.-).  This will be by addition into solution of CO.sub.2 in the molar ratio: CO.sub.2/Na=0.5, with respect to the sodium concentration of the water.  Forclarity, this assumption is coupled with the additional simplifying assumptions that all initial sodium associated anions at pH.about.10.5 are carbonate (CO.sub.3.sup.2-), and all final sodium-associated anions are bicarbonate (HCO.sub.3.sup.-) at lowerpH, and that sodium (Na) is the predominant cation active in the carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium.  (The last assumption follows from the prior precipitative removal of both calcium and magnesium by pH .about.10.5.) Using input data for sodium at 300meters depth in Lake Kivu\'s main basin from Tassi et al., (2009), Na .about.0.0175 moles/l, a rough estimate for CO.sub.2 absorption into the high-pH solution is: .about.0.0088 moles/l (=.about.0.39 grams per liter).  This may be compared to the initialCO.sub.2 concentration in the deepwater at 300 meters depth prior to degassing: CO.sub.2.about.0.055 moles/l, .about.2.42 g/l. Therefore if all of the return flow is bio-processed and de-densified, then .about.16%, roughly one sixth of the CO.sub.2degassing flux, is absorbable for pH-balancing prior to reinjection into Lake Kivu (at an appropriate density-matched depth in the interval .about.90 meters to .about.150 meters).  Adjustments for the addition of combustion-derived CO.sub.2 and othercorrections suggests that a reasonable expectation for CO.sub.2 utilization in pH-balancing is .about.12% of the total flux out of the OXFCPS.  For an output of .about.400 MW, this is roughly 1 MTA (Million Tonnes per Annum) of CO.sub.2.  Togethertherefore, biozone fertilization and return flow pH-balancing represent the second and third ""major modes"" of CO.sub.2 utilization, shown in FIG. 2 as vectors 2a, 2b and 3, respectively.  The simple estimates provided herein indicate it is possible toutilize quite a large fractional component of CO.sub.2 exhaust locally by shallow injection in Lake Kivu for biozone fertilization and return flow pH-balancing: altogether roughly one third of the total degassing flux of CO.sub.2.  (Note there is noincreased limnic eruption risk by these methods because the chemical state of the absorbed CO.sub.2 would be in the form of bicarbonate anion in a chemical state close to that of water in the biozone.)', 'The fourth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization (FIG. 2, arrow 4) is a pH-controlling modality preparatory to return flow into an algal growth sector.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  CO.sub.2 input in this modalityis shown in FIG. 8 as flow vector 12a providing CO.sub.2 in item 17a.  Item 17a is a diffuser.  It adds CO.sub.2 into solution prior to flow into an algal growth sector identified as item 18.  No estimate for this modality is provided in table 2.  Thescale of CO.sub.2 input is dependent on a range of factors having to do with the specific conditions of degassing and specifications for control over Mg and Ca precipitation.', 'The fifth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization (FIG. 2, arrow 5) is local algal production.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  CO.sub.2 is disseminated into algal biocultures both by direct CO.sub.2 dissolution intobiocultures and indirectly by addition of sodium bicarbonate (which may be formed by water absorbing carbonation of alkaline brine or sodium carbonate molecules, Na.sub.2CO.sub.3, into two bicarbonate molecules NaHCO.sub.3).  Degassed Lake Kivu deepwatercarries dissolved inorganic carbon accessible for algal carbon fixation in the form of bicarbonate anion.  It also carries NPK bionutrients.  A substantial crop of algae therefore can be grown to certain concentration levels without adding any additionalcarbon source.  However, with addition of extra nutrients (as may be accessed by various methods of nutrient recycling in algal production and processing), further algal biomass can be grown if a new source of carbon is provided.  CO.sub.2 can be used asa carbon source for this purpose.  It may be utilized via a pH-lowering input chemistry, as noted herein, converting doubly-charged carbonate anions to singly-charged bicarbonate anions.  Algal production can follow a two-step focus: (i) first, initialseparation of very high value nutraceutical compounds, followed by (ii) high-pressure hydrothermal processing of residues with nutrient recycling for production of biofuels, bio-asphalt and bio-fertilizers.  The production of high-value nutraceuticalproducts depends on the species mix of algae grown.  It therefore depends on the biotechnological set-up, controls and inputs.  Many options are possible.  For example, CO.sub.2 may be used to grow diazotrophic cyanobacteria algae via P-only nutrientfeeding into biocultures.  Such biocultures also may be grown under various low-oxygen N.sub.2:CO.sub.2 canopy conditions to optimize cyanobacterial growth and dominance conditions (Smith and Evans, 1971; Fay, 1992; Thomas et al., 2005; Berman-Frank etal., 2005; Molot et al., 2014).  This produces cyanobacteria biomass harvestable as NP-rich biofertilizers where nitrogen has been fixed by the diazotrophic activity of the cyanobacteria, and where carbon has been fixed by photosynthesis from theCO.sub.2.  CO.sub.2 additionally may be utilized as a coagulation-flocculation agent in harvesting, as noted herein.  CO.sub.2 may be used for post-harvest processing to separate algal oil, including high-value nutraceutical/pharmaceutical components. Algal biomass production can utilize CO.sub.2 in many and different ways.', ""Two estimates for CO.sub.2 utilization follow relating to algal production.  If 0.5 MTA CO.sub.2 is utilized for carbonation of (1.2 MTA of) sodium carbonate, (Na.sub.2CO.sub.3), to sodium bicarbonate, (NaHCO.sub.3), then the amount of sodiumbicarbonate produced at 100% efficiency is: .about.1.9 MTA.  Some fraction of this sodium bicarbonate production may be used for large-scale algal production, for example growing spirulina as a high-value protein and nutrients source for mother and childnutritional supplement feeding addressing widespread regional dietary protein deficiency.  Second, if 1.0 MTA CO.sub.2 is directly diffused into algal bioculture, then if .about.1/2 of that carbon is harvestable in algal biomass, and if .about.1/2 ofthat carbon is convertible into (for example) transportation biofuel carbon (therefore a carbon mass of: 1MTA.times.12/44.times.0.25.about.80,000 tonnes/yr), then the amount of refined biofuel (assuming an average molecular formula: C.sub.12H.sub.23)produced is .about.93,000 tonnes per year, or .about.110 million liters at a density of .about.0.83 tonnes per 1,000 liters.  For comparison, Rwanda's total annual consumption of transportation fuel is roughly 400 million liters.  Overall, ambitioustarget scales for algal bioproduction utilization for Lake Kivu CO.sub.2 ranges roughly from 0.5 to 5 MTA.  The scale of direction of CO.sub.2 utilization is dependent on the techno-economics of developing appropriate engineering biosystems for algalgrowth and harvesting integrated with biomaterials processing (such as for high-value nutraceutical/pharmaceutical oil production followed by high-pressure hydrothermal residue processing into fertilizers, biofuels, syngas and other products)."", 'The sixth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is pressurized CO.sub.2 delivery by pipeline.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Typically, pressurized CO.sub.2 delivery by pipeline is in high volumes over substantialdistances.  As this ""main mode"" specifies a gas specification and associated delivery technology, several specific ""main modes"" of CO.sub.2 utilization are referenced together under this mode.  All are included as preferred embodiments.  Five specifictypes of CO.sub.2 utilization by means of this method of CO.sub.2 delivery are included.  The first example of a potential large-scale use of high-pressure CO.sub.2 delivered by a long pipeline is CO.sub.2 delivered for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) to theAlbertine Rift of the Uganda-DRC border region, or to any future area in the region found to be oil-rich, including locations within the Lake Kivu basin itself.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Oil-bearing formations areknown to exist roughly from south of Lake Edward north along the border rift through to the northern boundary of Lake Albert.  At present, the entire extractable oil resource is estimated to be .about.2 billion barrels.  Initial oil extraction operationshave been developed on Lake Albert.  This location is roughly 400 km northeast of the northern boundary of Lake Kivu.', 'The second example of a potentially large-scale use of high-pressure dehydrated CO.sub.2 delivered at a distance by CO.sub.2 pipeline is large-scale olivine carbonation.  This use of CO.sub.2 for this purpose typically would be associated withmining activity, typically involving dunite-containing nickel-rich ore bodies.  Such bodies exist in the NE of Rwanda as well as in Tanzania and Burundi close to their borders with Rwanda.  Olivine carbonation can be a greentech method of nickel miningwhen dunite deposits are available with high nickel contents and/or that contain nickel-concentrating sulfides.  Olivine carbonation also can be used as a way to produce silicic acid together with iron and magnesium carbonates.  This mix is useful forplant feeding as a mineral fertilizer.  Uses include algal biomass fertilization focused on diatom species (many of which require silicon feeding).  Utilization of CO.sub.2 for the production of mineral fertilizers for diatom algal production within aLake Kivu CO.sub.2-UH is an attractive prospect in view of associated high-value nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals export potential.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.', 'The third example is delivery of CO.sub.2 for distant greenhouse horticultural utilization, (for example in Kenya).  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.', 'The fourth example is delivery of CO.sub.2 for use in ""solar fuels"" and/or ""solar chemicals"" (or, more generally, ""renewables-based"" fuels and chemicals) manufacture in connection with renewable electric power provided by solar arrays and/or bywind farms, and/or from hydropower.  Pipeline export of CO.sub.2 may be combined with CO.sub.2-EOR, for example, in eastern components of the East African rift in both Kenya and Tanzania where there are rift oil sectors as well as zones of very highaverage solar radiation intensity suitable for large solar power generation arrays (see: Solargis, 2011).  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.', 'The fifth example is delivery of high-pressure pipeline CO.sub.2 to areas in Kenya and Tanzania where sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate-rich brines are mined and processed, and where CO.sub.2 carbonation can produce a sodium bicarbonateproduct, and where solar radiation conditions are excellent for high-value algal biomass production in alkaline biocultures, for example spirulina farming.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.', 'The seventh ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization involves cryogenic treatment to create CO.sub.2 products by refrigeration, both liquid and solid CO.sub.2.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  It is a mode of CO.sub.2preparation and delivery rather than a specified mode of CO.sub.2 utilization.  Therefore several specified sub-modes are included within this section as preferred embodiments.  Again, refrigerated CO.sub.2 may be in the form of liquefied CO.sub.2 and/oras dry ice.  Both of these modes are shown in FIG. 3 as process trains labeled 25 and 26, respectively.  Liquefied CO.sub.2 is transported across long distances in large amounts typically in thermally insulated tanker trucks and large ships similar tothose used for LNG transportation.  In central Africa, liquid CO.sub.2 may be transported by insulated tanker truck.  It may be delivered for many uses.  These uses do not depend on the CO.sub.2 being in a liquid form in so far as liquefaction simply canbe an efficient mode for transporting CO.sub.2 utilized in other forms.  Uses include, for example, beverage carbonation, insect protection and fumigation (for example in grain storage), horticultural use (including algal production), wastewaterpH-lowering, tank re-filling for example for local dry ice manufacturing, food product packaging, use in supercritical extraction processing, supercritical CO.sub.2 dry cleaning, medical gas mixing, waterless textiles dyeing, charging of fireextinguishing systems and refrigeration systems using CO.sub.2 as a thermal transfer fluid, cold pasteurization of milk, beer and juices, humane animal slaughtering, CO.sub.2 fracking or frack fluid mixing, and lithium processing.  Liquid CO.sub.2 alsomay be transported by means of short-distance insulated pipelines, for example within a geographically disseminated CO.sub.2-UH.  An estimate for potential CO.sub.2 utilization of liquid CO.sub.2 in the region is .about.50,000 tonnes per year.', 'Dry ice typically is transported in insulated and/or refrigerated delivery trucks.  It also can be sub-delivered in insulated packages via motorbikes to remote off-grid locations.  It is generally used as a coolant.  In the area of Lake Kivu,dry ice can be utilized to supply needs for off-grid refrigeration.  An example is delivery as a refrigerant with beverages served chilled and/or with spoilable meats, including fish.  If beverages are supplied in kegs or other tanks, then off-grid dryice refrigeration makes it possible to avoid the high cost of bottles and bottling.  Dry ice also can be used as a non-wetting refrigerant to be used within coolers and other insulated packaging for truck transport of perishables (such as fish, milk,flowers and fruits) in trucks otherwise not equipped for cargo refrigeration.  An estimate for potential CO.sub.2 utilization as dry ice in the region may be as high as 50,000 tonnes per year for such uses.  Altogether, therefore, a rough estimate underthis sixth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is .about.100,000 tonnes per year in total.  Dry ice production is a preferred embodiment of the invention.', 'The eighth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is provision of unprocessed or mildly processed hot and wet (steam-rich) exhaust from oxyfuel combustion into cementing mineral carbonation in the production of concrete products and other buildingmaterials that include mineral cements.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  It is shown in FIG. 2 as vector 8.  It also is shown in FIG. 3 as the example displayed for the representation of the process train labeled as 22. This process can use magnesium hydroxide (brucite) as the main reactant with CO.sub.2 for mineralization into various Mg-carbonates.  Or it can remineralize pre-carbonated nesquahonite to generate various output carbonated and hydrated mineralogies.  Orit can involve CO.sub.2 carbonation of conventional Portland cements in various ways.  The use of magnesium is of special interest for Lake Kivu.  This is because it can be obtained as a precipitated product of de-densifying return flow water treatmentaccording to the method disclosed by the inventor in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 20160257577 A1.  The scale of CO.sub.2 use by this method can be estimated at a minimum scale via the flux of precipitated magnesium associated with treatmentor degassed return flow deepwater according to the above-noted method.  Magnesium hydroxide stoichiometry is used as the example.  Scaled to a 400 MW power output, the dissolved Mg flux through the degassing system is close to 0.6 MTA of magnesium. Given assumptions of (for example) .about.90% Mg capture and .about.70% partitioning of return flow into an Mg-precipitating water treatment mode, the captured Mg flux estimate is: .about.0.4 MTA Mg.  Using a nesquahonite composition,(MgCO.sub.3.3H.sub.2O), for a carbonation target composition, the mass flow of the associated Mg-based component of carbonated and hydrated cement is .about.2.3 MTA for the hydrated Mg-based cement component.  (For comparison, Rwanda\'s dominant cementproducer, CIMERWA, produces .about.0.6 MTA of dryweight Portland cement.  Bateta, 2015).  The rate of CO.sub.2 consumption for cementitious mineralization in this process is .about.0.7 MTA CO.sub.2.  For concrete with a mass ratio of >5 foraggregate-to-cement, this corresponds to in excess of 12 million tonnes of concrete production per year.  Moreover, in concretes cementing with Mg-hydroxide (""brucite"") carbonation reactions, CO.sub.2 additionally can be mineralized by carbonationreactions within pozzolanic aggregates.  And, as an alternative, CO.sub.2 can be mineralized into ordinary cementing reactions with Portland-type cement chemistries using pressure chambers for setting and curing.  Overall, there are many opportunitiesacross a range of cementitious chemistries and pozzolan addition situations.  A rough estimate of utilizable CO.sub.2 from cementitious mineralization-incorporation is: .about.1 MTA CO.sub.2.  This scale of CO.sub.2 utilization represents a giganticcapacity for CO.sub.2-mineralizing eco-concrete production.  It represents more than a doubling of Rwanda\'s circa 2015 cement production capacity.  CO.sub.2-mineralizing eco-concrete and related building materials may be factory-made as pre-cast moldedstock.  Advanced CO.sub.2-mineralizing eco-concretes may be developed that can be poured and set (and process remineralized) in the field.  CO.sub.2-mineralizing eco-concrete production are included as embodiments of the invention, capturing degassed(and post methane combustion) Lake Kivu CO.sub.2 into building materials.', 'The ninth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is urea manufacture.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  The potential for urea production in the context of the invention disclosed herein follows from the availability ofCO.sub.2 and also from the fact that a large flux of ammonium ion is present in Lake Kivu deepwater passing through the TDS.  Additionally, the Air Separation Unit (ASU) component of the OXFCPS generates a large flux of purified nitrogen gas.  This canbe used for ammonia (NH.sub.3) production, combining with H.sub.2.  Algal biomass processing also can use methods that allow nutrient recycling that allows capture of ammonia.  At a power production level of 400 MW, the mass of urea equivalent for 100%capture and conversion of NH.sub.4.sup.+ flux present in the extracted deepwater stream is 212,000 tonnes per year.  This is equivalent to .about.200,000 tonnes per year of ammonia (NH.sub.3).  This number provides a useful reference point.  For ureasynthesis, CO.sub.2 is used on a molar ratio basis of CO.sub.2/NH.sub.3=1.0.  Therefore a flux of .about.200,000 tonnes of ammonia determines an intake of .about.518,000 tonnes of CO.sub.2.  Assuming, for example, a situation of capture and conversion of.about.60% of the ammonium flux through deepwater processing, then CO.sub.2 utilization is .about.300,000 tonnes per year and urea production is .about.400,000 tonnes per year.  No disclosure of a method or system for removal of this ammonium from LakeKivu deepwater is included herein.', 'The tenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is formic acid production.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  As referenced herein, there are many possibilities for modes of production utilizing CO.sub.2 to produceformic acid.  These include production with electrolytic hydrogen as a ""solar chemical"" or ""solar fuel,"" and hydrothermal production using water as the hydrogen source linked with zero-valent metals redox cycling.  Both CO.sub.2 and formic acid also canbe used for animal hide processing and as tanning agents in developing a leather products industry.  A reasonable target for CO.sub.2 utilization to produce formic acid is 10,000 tonnes per year.  A much larger scale of production would be possible ifformic acid fuel cell technologies were to become widespread.', 'The eleventh ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is production of carbon monoxide (CO).  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Carbon monoxide has use in metals smelting, especially tin (Sn), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe). Several modes for CO production from CO.sub.2 have been described herein, such as, for example, that of Igor Lubomirsky and his Weitzmann Institute colleagues.  Lubomirsky\'s method creates both CO and a separated stream of O.sub.2 gas useful for inputinto oxyfuel combustion as shown in FIG. 2, flow vector 31.  Rwanda has long been a tin-producing country utilizing cassiterite-rich ores.  Rwandan cassiterite (SnO.sub.2) production circa 2015 is approximately 5,000 tonnes per year.  Potentialproduction capacity is much higher.  A rough estimate of the amount of CO.sub.2 needed to smelt cassiterite from CO is a molar ratio of .about.2CO.sub.2/SnO.sub.2, corresponding to a mass ratio of .about.0.58.  Consequently, a rough estimate of CO.sub.2potential for CO production for cassiterite smelting is .about.3,000 tonnes per year scaled to Rwandan production.  Much larger amounts of carbon monoxide could be utilized for scaled-up tin production as well as for smelting of other metal oxide oresand for metals processing.', 'The twelfth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is input of CO.sub.2 into the manufacture of pyrethrum biopesticide.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Pyrethrum biopesticide is sold in returnable pressurized tankbottles of CO.sub.2.  CO.sub.2 functions in a dual mode as a greentech solvent and non-toxic propellant.  Pyrethrum-in-CO.sub.2 ""organic"" biopesticide can be used in greenhouses as a form of insecticide that additionally provides CO.sub.2 plantfertilization.  Organic biopesticides have a potentially very large market.  In the region of Lake Kivu, this market can scale with the growth of high-intensity greenhouse cultivation with CO.sub.2 yield boosting.  A rough estimate for CO.sub.2utilization in this eleventh category is included as 20,000 tonnes per year.', 'The thirteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is for CO.sub.2 use in forest products production.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  This is a wide category.  Many types of inputs are possible.  An example isusing supercritical CO.sub.2, formic acid and sodium carbonate chemicals for pulping of bamboo to produce bamboo-based chemicals (such a xylitol), paper, viscose-type bamboo textiles and lignocellulosic biofuels.  No estimate for a scale of utilizationis presented.  Bioprocessing of forest products using CO.sub.2 and derivative chemicals represents a huge opportunity in the Lake Kivu region.  This is in view of the great forests of the DRC existing to the west of the Lake.', 'The fourteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is CO.sub.2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) (and/or mixed CO.sub.2--H.sub.2O plume) extraction of geothermal energy, possibly connected with CO.sub.2 geosequestration.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilizationis a preferred embodiment.  Lake Kivu is situated in a region with huge geothermal resources.  No estimate for a scale of utilization is presented.', 'The fifteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is fuels production by reaction of CO.sub.2 with hydrogen, and/or water, and/or methane in various production processes, with or without electric power inputs, yielding methanol, dimethyl ether(DME) and other fuels and chemicals, including those produced by mini-GTL processes.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Many such methods are referenced and briefly reviewed herein.  Many additional methods will be developedin the future as relatively small scale GTL technologies develop and grow, and as new economically viable turnkey plant options are developed to use stranded and/or otherwise flared natural gas, and also as CO.sub.2-utilizing transport fuels productionoptions become commercially viable based on the need for energy storage from intermittent supplies of renewable electric power (that is: ""solar-"" or ""electro-"" fuels and chemicals).  Methanol and DME are of particular interest in the location of LakeKivu.  They both can be utilized as a transport fuel fuels and fuel additives.  DME also could be used as a cost-lowering substitute for imported bottled propane gas used in home cooking and by businesses.  DME additionally can be useful for algalproducts processing utilizing wet algal biomass, as noted herein.  Both methanol and DME also are of special global environmental interest.  They represent the CO.sub.2-recycling ""methanol economy"" vision of George Olah and colleagues.  No estimate for ascale of utilization is presented.', 'The sixteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is a special case of the previous main mode.  It is input of hot CO.sub.2 plus steam exhaust from the OXFCPS into syngas production of methanol and DME.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is apreferred embodiment.  It aims to capture heat energy from combustion for CO.sub.2 utilization purposes using the outflow of the OXFCPS exhaust directly.  It includes, for example, application of methods and systems of technologies of the type beingdeveloped by the Danish company Haldor Topsoe for the transformation of inputs of CO.sub.2, steam and mechanical and/or electric power into outputs of methanol and oxygen gas (Hansen, 2014ab, 2015a,c,f).  These methods involve designs that incorporateSolid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technologies into production of syngas from CO.sub.2 and steam mixtures.  The OXFCPS submethod and subsystem described as a part of the invention disclosed herein generates exhaust outputs of CO.sub.2, steam andelectric power.  OXFCPS exhaust and power production therefore matches inputs to the new technology being developed by Haldor Topsoe, though not necessarily with the correct range of H.sub.2O/CO.sub.2 input ratios.  However, heat capture within thesystem can modulate steam addition to reach targets for the input ratio of H.sub.2O to CO.sub.2 into the reactor system.  Extra power for CO.sub.2 plus steam electrolysis via SOEC can be obtained additionally from renewable energy inputs transmitted byhigh-voltage wires.  An extra bonus is that in an integrated system, co-produced O.sub.2 can be fed into the input into oxyfuel combustion.  No estimate for a scale of utilization is presented.', 'The seventeenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is another special case of a previous main mode.  It is inputs of CO.sub.2 and water into electrosynthesis of various chemicals via formate and oxalic acid (H.sub.2C.sub.2O.sub.4) platformssuch are being developed by the company Liquid Light, for example for the production on mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) for use in production of PET plastic bottles.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Use of these methods withsolar power inputs generates ""solar chemicals"" (including ""solar fuels"").  This displaces the use of petroleum by utilizing waste CO.sub.2 as an alternate carbon source.  No estimate for a scale of utilization is presented.', 'The eighteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is deployment of gas fermentation biotechnologies based on the microbial Wood-Ljundahl pathway to produce acetate and other chemicals.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferredembodiment.  It is done via inputs of either mixtures of CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2 mixtures, or CO.sub.2 alone with electrons provided to the microbes (""electrobiosynthesis"").  As noted herein, the company LanzaTech is developing these methods commercially. No estimate for a scale of utilization is presented.', 'The nineteenth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is plastics manufacture with chemical incorporation of CO.sub.2.  This mode of CO.sub.2 utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Examples of technologies include the processes of CO.sub.2incorporation into CO.sub.2-polyols developed by companies such as Novomer, Bayer/Covestro and Econic Technologies.  CO.sub.2-utilizing plastics can be produced in synergy with the production of CO.sub.2-utilizing bioplastics, for example using algalbiomass and/or separated algal oils.  No estimate for a scale of utilization is presented.', 'The twentieth ""main mode"" of CO.sub.2 utilization is high-value carbon products production.  What is referred to by ""carbon products"" is products composed mostly (though not strictly only) of forms of elemental carbon.  This mode of CO.sub.2utilization is a preferred embodiment.  Examples of attractive possibilities are dense nanoporous graphene used in supercapacitors, carbon nanotubes used in new battery technologies, and carbon nanofibers used in high-strength composites.  Byproductoxygen gas can feed O.sub.2 into the ASU oxygen supply for oxyfuel (as shown by flow vector 31 in FIG. 2).  Using an oxygen stream that otherwise might be vented as a waste can provide an efficiency boost in cases where large quantities of CO.sub.2 areutilized to produce carbon products by splitting CO.sub.2 into C and O.sub.2.', 'An additional preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed herein pertains to a co-product adjunct to CO.sub.2.  This is purified nitrogen in both gaseous (N.sub.2) and liquefied forms (LN.sub.2).  Purified nitrogen is co-produced with pureoxygen gas in the submethod and subsystem of an Air Separation Unit (ASU).  As shown in FIG. 2, box 1, the OXFCPS overall is defined to be an integrative combination of items 26, 27, 28 and 29, with item 27 being an ASU.  An ASU is herein defined to beany technology that can obtain a supply of separated O.sub.2 for infeed into oxyfuel combustion.  A cryogenic air separation unit is the conventional (but by no means the only) technology component of the overall OXFCPS.  If implemented in a specificdesign as an option within the overall scope of the invention disclosed herein, a cryogenic ASU produces an adjunct supply of liquefied nitrogen gas (N.sub.2).  This is shown in FIG. 2 as a part of item 27, yielding flows of liquid (or gaseous) nitrogen. These flows are shown as flow vectors 39 and 40.  Flow vector 39 enters the CO.sub.2-UH (via item 30 where cryo-capacities are present).', 'Production of cryo-liquefied nitrogen (LN.sub.2 or LN2) by the ASU also is shown in FIG. 6.  FIG. 6 shows a preferred embodiment utilizing this LN.sub.2 both for cryo-energy storage and for cooling of a Digital Data Center (DDC).  Cryogenicenergy provided by the ASU in the form of LN.sub.2 (or LO.sub.2) can be used in the production of liquefied and/or solidified CO.sub.2 within the CO.sub.2-UH (FIG. 2, item 21).  Also it can be utilized independently of the CO.sub.2-UH, as shown by flowvector 40 in FIG. 2.  The capacity of the overall system to produce and store liquefied N.sub.2 in excess of that used within the ASU (for energy recycling efficiency) can be considered as an adjunct capacity assisting powerplant efficiency as well asCO.sub.2 utilization.  Utilization of cold nitrogen gas also can supply Digital Data Center (DDC) cooling.  This is illustrated herein in FIG. 6 and its accompanying text.  Both cold N.sub.2 and LN.sub.2 also may be used for DDC cooling.  Use of coldnitrogen produced by OXFCPS operations as a utilization of otherwise wasted material and associated cryo-energy can assist realization of DDC industrialization by lessening the (often very substantial) electric power draw of such a facility.  Nitrogengas also has numerous other productive uses, for example in algal production where it provides a N.sub.2 source for diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) cyanobacteria.  It also is useful for algal culture sparging and related uses for removal ofgrowth-inhibiting O.sub.2.  Nitrogen gas also may provide basic chemical inputs for various purposes into a large number of types of chemical synthesis reactions.  FIG. 6 shows a preferred embodiment (as item 13) providing a source of ""warm"" nitrogen gasas an outflow of cold nitrogen into DDC cooling.  This cooling is fed either directly from stored LN.sub.2 (FIG. 6, item 11) or from cold nitrogen gas after being used in recovery of stored cryo-energy (cf, FIG. 6, item 18c feeding an outflow as item12).  More generally, the overall method and system provides nitrogen gas as outflow (FIG. 6, item 12) that is available for utilization for any purposes.', 'An additional adjunct capacity of the invention is production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and associated forms of Natural Gas (NG) that can be produced and sold as a consequence of the capability to separate natural gas (see FIG. 6, item 40)from an inflow of mixed NG and CO.sub.2 from Lake Kivu (FIG. 6, item 38).  (NB: NG deriving from Lake Kivu is biogas.) These associated forms of NG are highly useful for various purposes.  These can be produced and sold as adjunct capacities of theinvention in preferred embodiments.  They are: (i) Compressed Natural Gas (CNG, see Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas), and Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG, see Wikipedia entry:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorbed_natural_gas).  The capacity to produce NG in any of these forms (LNG, CNG, ANG) derives from a CO.sub.2 separation processing function within the CO.sub.2-UH (FIG. 6, Box 4).  This CO.sub.2 separation processingfunction produces dry ice and/or LCO.sub.2.  It is indicated in FIG. 6 circumscribed within Box 36 (and including items 35, 37, 39 and 40).  This adjunct capacity for NG production is a part of the cryogenic capacities, including the cryogenic fluids andcryo-energy storage capacities, of the invention (FIG. 6, Box 28), and is a preferred embodiment.  Such an adjunct capacity has potent potential in the locus of Lake Kivu for purposes such as: (i) providing bottled NG (CNG and/or ANG) for home andbusiness cooking and other similar uses of heat energy from NG combustion; (ii) providing bottled NG (CNG and/or ANG) as a source of fuel for internal combustion engines such as, for example, those in motorcycles, cars and trucks modified to run on NG. Of course, the capacity to produce LNG for CO.sub.2 separation processing and cryo-energy storage also allows LNG to be sold as well as used as a stored energy ""backup"" reservoir of both cryo-energy and chemical energy for powerplant operations backuppurposes such as may be necessary, for example, in situations of maintenance and improvements of extractive degassing equipment.', 'While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific examples thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit andscope thereof.', 'REFERENCES CITED', ""1.  2b1sr Consulting, (2014).

Taxonomic profiling of the human microbiome via 16S rRNA geneamplicon sequencing has provided critical insight into the potential role of the microbiota in a wide array of common diseases, including (among others) bacterial vaginosis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis, but such profiling routinely falls short ofdescribing the etiology of these diseases.  This drawback may be due to the fact that, while 16S rRNA gene sequencing can provide species-level taxonomic profiles of a community, it does not describe the genes or metabolic functions that are encoded inthe constituents'genomes.  This is an important distinction because strains of a bacterial species often exhibit substantial diversity in gene content, such that their genomes harbor sets of accessory genes whose presence is variable.  It is thereforedifficult, if not impossible, to infer the complete function of a microbial species in an environment using only their 16S rRNA gene sequence.  As a consequence, to investigate the role of the human microbiome in health and disease, particular emphasismust be placed on describing the gene content and expression of these microbial communities."", 'Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiling are emerging approaches aimed at characterizing the gene content and expression of microbial communities.  Results from these approaches have led to increased appreciation for the important rolemicrobial communities play in human health and disease.  Despite the rapid development and increased throughput of sequencing technologies, however, current knowledge of the genetic and functional diversity of human microbial communities is stilllimited.  This is due, at least in part, to a lack of resources necessary for the analysis of these massive datasets; de novo assembly of metagenomic or metatranscriptomic datasets typically requires substantial computational resources and complicatesintegration of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data.', 'Accurate, high-resolution mapping of metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data against a comprehensive and curated gene database is an alternative analytical strategy that is less computationally demanding, prone to fewer errors, and provides astandard point of reference for comparison of these data.  Development of such curated databases is crucial to furthering understanding of the structure and function of microbial communities.  In recent years, international initiatives such as MetaHit,the NIH-funded Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC) have been established to generate the resources necessary to enable investigations of the human microbiome, including large reference taxonomicsurveys and metagenomic datasets.  While multiple 16S rRNA gene catalogs exist, there are relatively few curated resources for referencing metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, and those that do exist focus only on the gut microbiome of either humans oranimal model species.', ""Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that allelic differences in certain genes in the human microbiota may be associated with health or disease, and such allelic differences may thus be useful as selection criteria and/or biomarkers foridentification of suitable probiotic strains for use in live biotherapeutic formulations.  However, the difficulty of generating gene-specific characterizations of a person's microbiome and a reference gene catalog of a human microbiome have, to date,limited the ability of investigators to discover and exploit such gene-specific health outcomes to formulate live biotherapeutics."", 'There is thus a need in the art for methods for creating reference gene catalogs for microbiomes of human body sites other than the gut, such as the oral cavity, the skin, and the vagina.  There is a further need in the art for methods forformulating and administering live biotherapeutic formulations based on such reference gene catalogs.', 'SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'Microbiome studies have become increasingly sophisticated with the rapid advancement of sequencing throughput and the associated decrease in sequencing cost.  However, identifying features that drive correlations between the microbiome andhealth using multi-omics sequencing data remains challenging.  This is due, in part, to difficulties in analyzing and integrating the complex metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data now common to microbiome studies.  A scalable tool that provides acomprehensive characterization of such multi-omics data is therefore highly desired.  Reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can be large microbiome databases designed to fulfill such research needs for investigations ofmicrobiomes and their relation to health, e.g. the vaginal microbiome and its relation to reproductive and urogenital health in women.  In summary, reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention may provide any one or more of thefollowing advantages and benefits relative to the solutions of the prior art: (i) comprehensive breadth, including previously observed community types, species, and even fungi and viruses; (ii) a gene-specific design that enables the integration offunctional and taxonomic characterization of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data originating from the same sample; (iii) a high scalability and low memory requirement; (iv) a high sensitivity that affords characterization of the gene content oflow-abundance bacteria; (v) an easy-to-use framework from which to evaluate gene richness and within-species diversity.', 'Reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can contain a multitude of non-redundant genes that can be identified from metagenomes and bacterial isolates.  These non-redundant genes can also be clustered into orthologousgroups, e.g. vaginal orthologous groups (VOGs) when the microbiome being investigated is the vaginal microbiome, using a memory-efficient network-based algorithm that handles node connectivity in high-dimensionality space.  This approach to identifyingorthologous protein sequences allows for great flexibility because it does not rely on a single sequence similarity cutoff value.  These families of orthologs can assist the development of a mechanistic understanding of these proteins and how they relateto health.  For example, the L. crispatus pullulanase (pulA) has recently been identified, characterized, and shown to encode an enzyme with amylase activity, which likely allows the species to degrade host glycogen in the vaginal environment.  Using themethods of the present invention, the present inventors have been able to identify pullulanase domain-containing proteins in 37 other vaginal taxa, including G. vaginalis, L. iners, and P. timonensis, providing insight into the breadth of vaginalbacteria that may be capable of degrading host glycogen.  In this way, the methods and systems of the present invention can facilitate knowledge retrieval, hypothesis generation, future experimental validation, and the development of novel and/ortailored gene-specific live biotherapeutics for administration to a patient in need thereof.', 'Using the methods and systems of the present invention, the intraspecies diversity present within individual microbial communities, e.g. individual vaginal microbial communities, can be identified and characterized.  Populations of bacterialspecies in, for example, vaginal communities likely comprise multiple strains.  Previous studies of the vaginal microbiome have largely treated these species as singular genotypes, although some more recent studies have examined intraspecies diversity inthese communities.  Intraspecies diversity is important because it is likely to influence many properties of the communities, including their temporal stability and resilience and their relationship to host health.  However, intraspecies diversity isdifficult to detect using typical assembly-based metagenomic analysis strategies, which are notoriously ill-suited for resolving strains of the same species.  The methods and systems of the present invention can be a more suitable tool for characterizingintraspecies diversity because they are built to contain the non-redundant pangenomes of most species common to the microbial environment, e.g. the vagina.  Strict mapping of sequence reads against reference gene catalogs generated according to thepresent invention provides an accurate and sensitive way of identifying the aggregated non-redundant genes that belong to each species in a metagenome, and it is expressly contemplated that the methods and systems of the present invention may enablefuture investigations of intraspecies diversity, and leveraging of such intraspecies diversity (e.g. by formulating live biotherapeutics to regulate and/or maintain a degree of intraspecies diversity associated with health), in microbial communitiesincluding but not limited to the vaginal microbial community.', 'Methods and systems of the present invention can be used to determine not only the identity and characteristics of intraspecies diversity, but also the structure thereof.  As described in the non-limiting Examples that follow, vaginalmetagenomes derived from the microbiota from different subjects contain related sets of species-specific non-redundant genes.  Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these clusters of samples with shared gene contentrepresent similar collectives of strains, which the present inventors term ""metagenomic subspecies,"" and it is expected that, given their shared gene content, these metagenomic subspecies might also share phenotypic characteristics.  As a result, livebiotherapeutics can be formulated that include, or exclude, one or more identified metagenomic subspecies to provide, or avoid, an identified effect of the metagenomic subspecies on the health of the microbial environment, e.g. the vaginal microbialenvironment, and by extension the host.', 'One advantage and benefit of the present invention is its usefulness to generate reference gene catalogs that are both central repositories and highly scalable tools for fast, accurate characterization of a microbiome, e.g. a vaginal microbiome. The methods and systems of the present invention may be particularly useful for users with limited computational skills, a large volume of sequencing data, and/or limited computing infrastructure.  In particular, the metagenome-metatranscriptome dataintegration enabled by the gene-specific design of the methods and systems of the invention provides a powerful approach to determine the expression patterns of microbial functions, and in doing so to characterize contextualized complex mechanisms ofhost-microbiota interactions in microbial communities, e.g. vaginal communities.  This feature makes possible the meta-analysis of microbiome features and the quantitative integration of findings from multiple studies, which helps alleviate the commonissue of confounding gene copy number that has been a major challenge in analyzing metatranscriptomic datasets to date.  It is also anticipated that the methods and systems of the present invention may be used to process metaproteomic datasets when thatpractice becomes common and easily accessible.  Each of the protein sequences of each gene could be used to map peptides obtained from metaproteomic pipelines.  It is also expressly contemplated that the methods and systems of the present invention maybe useful to identify nucleotide variants within a gene--which will further facilitate understanding of within-species diversity and change in a microbial ecosystem, e.g. a vaginal ecosystem, and enable even more selective and/or targeted formulation oflive biotherapeutics--and embodiments incorporating this capability are within the scope of the present invention.  Furthermore, the methods and systems of the present invention are useful to generate reference gene catalogs including gene sequences ofnon-bacterial microbes, e.g. viral and fungal gene sequences, providing a more complete understanding of the microbial community of interest.', 'These and other advantages will be apparent from the disclosure contained herein.', 'For purposes of further disclosure and to comply with applicable written description and enablement requirements, the following references generally relate to systems and methods for formulation and administration of live biotherapeutics, andare hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties:', 'Vivien Pybus and Andrew B.

In the case of vaginal microbiomes specifically, such reference gene catalogs can be constructed using a combination of metagenomes and urogenital bacterial isolate genomes.  The genesidentified in these data can be further clustered into vaginal orthologous groups (VOGs), providing a catalog of functional protein families common to vaginal microbiomes.  The gene catalog can be curated with taxonomic assignments as well as functionalfeatures using diverse protein databases.  Importantly, the present inventors have shown that reference gene catalogs constructed according to the present invention can provide greater than 95% coverage of the human vaginal microbiome and be applicableto populations from North America, Africa, and Asia.  The methods and systems of the present invention can thus provide a comprehensive reference repository and a convenient cataloging tool for fast and accurate characterization of vaginal metagenomesand metatranscriptomes.  The reference gene catalogs produced according to the present invention can be compilations of vaginal bacterial species pangenomes, creating a vaginal ""meta-pan-genome."" Methods and systems of the present invention can befurther used to characterize the amount of intraspecies diversity present in individual vaginal communities; whereas previous characterization of these communities using either 16S rRNA gene taxonomic profiling or assembly-based metagenomic analyses hasfailed to resolve this diversity, the present inventors have shown that vaginal communities contain far more intraspecies diversity than originally expected.  This insight challenges the conventional idea that the vaginal microbiota are dominated by onestrain, or even one species, of Lactobacillus, and has major implications for the ecology of these otherwise low-diversity bacterial communities.  Ultimately, reference gene catalogs produced according to the present invention and their associatedanalytical frameworks can facilitate and standardize the analysis and interpretation of large metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, thus expanding understanding of the role of vaginal microbial communities in health and disease.', 'Methods for constructing or generating a reference gene catalog according to the present invention generally comprise at least one data collection step, at least one data processing step, and at least one redundancy removal step.  In the atleast one data collection step, metagenomes and/or isolate genomes from one or more microbial communities are generally obtained and/or newly sequenced.  The at least one data processing step generally comprises at least one step or sub-step selectedfrom the following: (i) preprocessing sequence data for each of one or more samples, e.g. by removing human contaminants from a sample, quality-filtering, and/or removing ribosomal RNA; (ii) assembling at least one metagenome from each of one or moresamples, e.g. by executing a procedure to generate one or more nucleotide based de novo assemblies; (iii) compiling coding DNA sequences (CDSs); (iv) taxonomic annotation, e.g. by transitive assignment of species name from reads mapping to contigs; and(v) functional annotation, e.g. using annotations from one or more functional databases.  The at least one redundancy removal step generally comprises at least one of clustering highly similar genes to avoid spurious inflation and keeping the longestgene of a gene cluster to remove gene fragments.  In embodiments, the method may further comprise at least one orthologous protein family grouping step, which generally comprises clustering genes using Jaccard index coefficiency.  Reference gene catalogsgenerated according to the present invention generally include, for each orthologous protein family group, at least one type of information selected from the following: (i) general attributes (e.g. gene symbol, taxonomic group, gene richness category);(ii) pathway attributes (e.g. ID and annotation); (iii) protein attributes (e.g. category and annotation); (iv) orthologous group attributes (e.g. protein family size, alignment score, taxonomic information, functional category); (v) alignment(s); (vi)phylogeny or phylogenies; (vii) nucleotide sequence(s); and (ix) amino acid sequence(s).', ""The present invention also provides methods and systems for treating a human patient with a live biotherapeutic formulation.

Deeper understandings of the complex mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions require the integration of multi-omics data.  The present invention provides for the generation of reference gene catalogs that serve as a central reference database and ananalytical framework to enable the efficient and accurate characterization of the microbial gene content of a microbiome, e.g. the human vaginal microbiome, and allows for the integrated analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data.  The presentinvention further provides a gene-specific approach to describe the structure of microbial communities, e.g. vaginal microbial communities, with fine-scale variation at the intraspecies level.  Such insights into intraspecies diversity within a microbialcommunity are far beyond the capabilities of current genome references and investigation tools.  The present invention also facilitates the analysis of multi-omics data now common to microbiome studies; provides comprehensive insight into communitymembership, function, and ecological perspective of a microbiome, e.g. the vaginal microbiome; and is useful to formulate gene-specific, and therefore more targeted and effective, live biotherapeutics.', 'Microbiome studies have become increasingly sophisticated with the rapid advancement of sequencing throughput and the associated decrease in sequencing cost.  However, identifying features that drive correlations between the microbiome andhealth using multi-omics sequencing data remains challenging.  This is due, in part, to difficulties in analyzing and integrating the complex metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data now common to microbiome studies.  A scalable tool that provides acomprehensive characterization of such multi-omics data is therefore highly desired.  Reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can be large microbiome databases designed to fulfill such research needs for investigations ofmicrobiomes and their relation to health, e.g. the vaginal microbiome and its relation to reproductive and urogenital health in women.  In summary, reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention may provide any one or more of thefollowing advantages and benefits relative to the solutions of the prior art: (i) comprehensive breadth, including previously observed community types, species, and even fungi and viruses; (ii) a gene-specific design that enables the integration offunctional and taxonomic characterization of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data originating from the same sample; (iii) a high scalability and low memory requirement; (iv) a high sensitivity that affords characterization of the gene content oflow-abundance bacteria; (v) an easy-to-use framework from which to evaluate gene richness and within-species diversity.', 'Reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can contain a multitude of non-redundant genes that can be identified from metagenomes and bacterial isolates.  These non-redundant genes can also be clustered into orthologousgroups, e.g. vaginal orthologous groups (VOGs) when the microbiome being investigated is the vaginal microbiome, using a memory-efficient network-based algorithm that handles node connectivity in high-dimensionality space.  This approach to identifyingorthologous protein sequences allows for great flexibility because it does not rely on a single sequence similarity cutoff value.  These families of orthologs can assist the development of a mechanistic understanding of these proteins and how they relateto health.  For example, the L. crispatus pullulanase (pulA) has recently been identified, characterized, and shown to encode an enzyme with amylase activity, which likely allows the species to degrade host glycogen in the vaginal environment.  Using themethods of the present invention, the present inventors have been able to identify pullulanase domain-containing proteins in 37 other vaginal taxa, including G. vaginalis, L. iners, and P. timonensis, providing insight into the breadth of vaginalbacteria that may be capable of degrading host glycogen.  In this way, the methods and systems of the present invention can facilitate knowledge retrieval, hypothesis generation, future experimental validation, and the development of novel and/ortailored gene-specific live biotherapeutics for administration to a patient in need thereof.', 'Using the methods and systems of the present invention, the intraspecies diversity present within individual microbial communities, e.g. individual vaginal microbial communities, can be identified and characterized.  Populations of bacterialspecies in, for example, vaginal communities likely comprise multiple strains.  Previous studies of the vaginal microbiome have largely treated these species as singular genotypes, although some more recent studies have examined intraspecies diversity inthese communities.  Intraspecies diversity is important because it is likely to influence many properties of the communities, including their temporal stability and resilience and their relationship to host health.  However, intraspecies diversity isdifficult to detect using typical assembly-based metagenomic analysis strategies, which are notoriously ill-suited for resolving strains of the same species.

As described in the non-limiting Examples that follow, vaginalmetagenomes from different subjects contain related sets of species-specific non-redundant genes.  Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these clusters of samples with shared gene content represent similar collectivesof strains, which the present inventors term ""metagenomic subspecies,"" and it is expected that, given their shared gene content, these metagenomic subspecies might also share phenotypic characteristics.  As a result, live biotherapeutics can beformulated that include, or exclude, one or more identified metagenomic subspecies to provide, or avoid, an identified effect of the metagenomic subspecies on the health of the microbial environment, e.g. the vaginal microbial environment.', 'One advantage and benefit of the present invention is its usefulness to generate reference gene catalogs that are both central repositories and highly scalable tools for fast, accurate characterization of a microbiome, e.g. a vaginal microbiome. The methods and systems of the present invention may be particularly useful for users with limited computational skills, a large volume of sequencing data, and/or limited computing infrastructure.  In particular, the metagenome-metatranscriptome dataintegration enabled by the gene-specific design of the methods and systems of the invention provides a powerful approach to determine the expression patterns of microbial functions, and in doing so to characterize contextualized complex mechanisms ofhost-microbiota interactions in microbial communities, e.g. vaginal communities.  This feature makes possible the meta-analysis of microbiome features and the quantitative integration of findings from multiple studies, which helps alleviate the commonissue of confounding gene copy number that has been a major challenge in analyzing metatranscriptomic datasets to date.  It is also anticipated that the methods and systems of the present invention may be used to process metaproteomic datasets when thatpractice becomes common and easily accessible.  Each of the protein sequences of each gene could be used to map peptides obtained from metaproteomic pipelines.  It is also expressly contemplated that the methods and systems of the present invention maybe useful to identify nucleotide variants within a gene--which will further facilitate understanding of within-species diversity and change in a microbial ecosystem, e.g. a vaginal ecosystem, and enable even more selective and/or targeted formulation oflive biotherapeutics--and embodiments incorporating this capability are within the scope of the present invention.  Furthermore, the methods and systems of the present invention are useful to generate reference gene catalogs including gene sequences ofnon-bacterial microbes, e.g. viral and fungal gene sequences, providing a more complete understanding of the microbial community of interest.', 'Formulation of Live Biotherapeutics for Vaginal Microbiome Treatment', 'In reproductive-age women, Lactobacillus spp.  are characteristic of an optimal vaginal microbiota.  Lactobacillus spp.  produce bacteriocins to suppress pathogenic growth of certain bacteria, as well as lactic acid.  Lactic acid lowers thevaginal pH to around 4.5 or less, hampering the survival of other bacteria.', 'The vaginal microbiome differs in important ways from other microbiomes; for example, while an optimal gut microbiome is a highly diverse, high-biomass microbial community, an optimal vaginal microbiome is characterized by low bacterialdiversity often dominated by one species of Lactobacillus.  Specifically, previous metataxonomic studies utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis have revealed that there are five major Community State Types (CSTs) of the vaginal microbiome, of whichfour are dominated by one species of Lactobacillus: CST I (dominated by L. crispatus), CST II (dominated by L. gasseri), CST III (dominated by L. iners), and CST V (dominated by L. jensenii).  CST IV, however, which includes the vaginal microbiomes ofabout 25% of women, is characterized by a relative dearth of Lactobacillus spp.  Low abundance of Lactobacillus in the vaginal microbiome is associated with increased risk for severe adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes.  Adverse gynecologicoutcomes associated with low Lactobacillus abundance include, but are not limited to, acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and humanpapillomavirus (HPV)), bacterial vaginosis (the most frequently cited cause of vaginal discharge and malodor), yeast infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  Adverse obstetric outcomes associated with lowLactobacillus abundance include, but are not limited to, preterm delivery and low birth weight, infertility, stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), postpartum and postabortal endometritis, amniotic fluid infection, and chorioamnionitis. Lactobacillus spp.  are thus key to reproductive and gynecological health, and not all CSTs are equally protective; CST IV is associated with high risk to these and other adverse health outcomes, and CST III is suboptimal compared to CSTs I, II, and V(see, e.g., Vonetta L. Edwards et al., ""The cervicovaginal microbiota-host interaction modulates Chlamydia trachomatis infection,"" 10(4) mBio e01548-19 (August 2019), and Kenetta L. Nunn et al., ""Enhanced trapping of HIV-1 by human cervicovaginal mucusis associated with Lactobacillus crispatus-dominant microbiota,"" 6(5) mBio e01084-15 (October 2015), the entireties of both of which are incorporated herein by reference).  Moreover, it is known that the distribution of vaginal microbiome CSTs varieswith race; for example, 40.5% of black women and 38.1% of Hispanic women harbor a CST IV vaginal microbiome, compared to 19.8% of Asian women and 10.3% of white women.', 'While several proposed solutions to the restoration and maintenance of vaginal microbiota associated with positive health outcomes exist, these proposed solutions suffer from several drawbacks.  The selection of strains used in the formulationof live biotherapeutics (LBPs) is empiric and is based on criteria such as adhesion or antimicrobial production, but little or no information is available on the women and the microbiota from which the strains were cultured.  Often, the LBPs comprisestrains of a particular species (e.g. L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii) that are not typically found in the vaginal microbiome.  In these approaches, there is no ecological or scientific rationale for strain selection, and the efficacy of LBPsformulated according to these approaches has yet to be demonstrated as superior to current drug treatments.', 'A list of selected currently available LBPs for maintenance of the vaginal microbiome is given in Table 1.', 'TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Formulation name Ingredients PHYSIOFLOR L. crispatus IP 174178 KRAMEGIN L. acidophilus + Krameria triandra plant extract + lactic acid GYNOFLOR L. acidophilus KS400 + estriol LACTAGYN L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, S.thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp.

Particularly, because thereference gene catalogs of the present invention are comprehensive, have broad application to different populations and ethnicities, and reveal extensive within-woman intraspecies diversity, those who wish to formulate LBPs for restoration of the vaginalmicrobiota can identify multiple strains of a species that may contribute to (or detract from) the health of the vaginal environment and provide functional redundancy that guarantees stability of the species in situ in the vaginal environment.  Thepresent invention allows reference gene catalogs created thereby to be leveraged to rationally design and select one or more bacterial strains, or a mixture (""consortium"") thereof, as therapeutics.', 'The present inventors have identified certain features that may be desired in LBP formulations to provide stability and resilience to the vaginal microbiome.  By way of non-limiting example, not all L. crispatus strains are equally beneficial tohost health; vaginal microbiota dominated by L. crispatus can be highly stable, but can also lack resilience upon disturbance, such as the use of a lubricant or sexual intercourse.  It is desirable to provide vaginal microbiota dominated by stable andresilient L. crispatus, but prior to the present invention, no known characteristics could predict the stability of L. crispatus.', 'EXAMPLES', 'The invention is further described by way of the following non-limiting Examples.', 'Example 1: Construction of Human Vaginal Non-Redundant Gene Catalog', 'This Example describes the construction of a human vaginal non-redundant gene catalog (VIRGO) according to the methods of the present invention.', '211 newly sequenced vaginal datasets and 53 vaginal datasets downloaded from the HMP data repository were obtained.

A secondary filterwas applied so that the total number of mismatches between the read and the reference was less than 35 and the first 25 bp of the read matched the reference.  Using the results of this mapping, taxonomy was assigned to all genes encoded on the contigthat matched the following four criteria: (1) at least 95% of the reads mapped to the same bacterial species, (2) the remaining 5% of off-target reads did not map to a single species, (3) the contig had at least 2.times.  average coverage and more than50 reads, and (4) at least 25% of the total length of the contig had reads mapped thereon.  These stringent criteria were used to ensure high fidelity of the taxonomic assignments and a low contribution of potentially chimeric contigs.  To furtherdiminish the risk of incorporating false taxonomic assignments, the annotations of the contigs belonging to species at low relative abundance in the sample were removed.  Genome completeness was estimated as the fractional representation of the genome inthe metagenome using BLASTN (minimal overlapping of more than 60% of the shorter sequence and more than 80% sequence similarity).  For each metagenome, only taxonomic assignments originating from species with at least 80% representation wereincorporated.  The genes that showed more than 80% sequence similarity to the non-redundant genes over 60% of query gene length were then assigned.  The non-redundant genes in VIRGO were searched against a fungal database that included five vaginal yeastspecies in 40 genomes using BLASTN, such that a gene must have at least 80% sequence similarity over 60% of overlapping length to be curated.  Potential phage genes that may be present in VIRGO were also annotated by searching against phage orthologousgroups or prokaryotic virus orthologous groups (version 2016, as described in David M.

When stratified by CST, CST IV metagenomes have the smallest proportion (less than 30%) oftheir gene content taxonomically annotated, compared to about 45% to 50% in Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs.  The most abundant species based on gene content are shown in FIG. 3C.  The curated potential fungal and phage genes were generally present in lowabundance (0.17%.+-.0.04% and 0.03%.noteq.0.001%, respectively).  An additional 10,908 fungal genes and 15,965 phage genes--were included.', 'Overall, 785,268 genes--82.8% of all non-redundant genes--were assigned a functional annotation from at least one source.  This gene-rich annotation of the non-redundant gene catalog enables a comprehensive functional characterization of vaginalmetagenomes and metatranscriptomes.', 'The community gene content, or gene richness, can be characterized as the number of non-redundant genes.  As illustrated in FIG. 4A, Lactobacillus-dominated communities were typically categorized as low gene count (LGC), as 82.9% of thesecommunities have fewer than 1,000 genes; Lactobacillus-deficient communities commonly have high gene count (HGC), in that 88.3% of these communities have more than 1,000 genes.  Further, genes of a particular vaginal species can be overrepresented in HGCor LGC vaginal communities (FIG. 4B) with distinct functional makeups.  Lactobacillus spp., particularly L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and L. vaginalis, were observed to be highly overrepresented in LGC communities.

An all-against-all BLASTP search was performed among the translated coding sequences (CDS) of the non-redundant genes included in VIRGO.  The all-against-all BLASTP matches wereused to compute a Jaccard similarity coefficient for each pair of translated CDSs, without constraints based on the sample or organism from which it originated.  Only BLASTP matches with at least 80% sequence identity, at least 70% overlap, and anE-value of less than 1E-10 were used in the calculation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient.  The filtered BLASTP results were then used to define connections between pairs of translated CDSs, resulting in a network graph with the translated CDSs asnodes and their connections as edges.  The Jaccard similarity coefficient was then calculated as the number of nodes that had direct connections to the two translated CDSs divided by the total number of nodes that had direct connections to either of thetwo translated CDSs in the network (intersection divided by union, as described in Jonathan Crabtree et al. ""Sybil: methods and software for multiple genome comparison and visualization,"" in Michael F.

A Jaccard cluster (JACs) was defined as a set of translated CDSs whose Jaccard similarity coefficient was at least 0.55.  If two translated CDSs from different JACs were reciprocal best matchesaccording to the BLASTP searches, the two JACs were merged and defined as Jaccard orthologous clusters (JOCs).  Finally, the alignment program T-Coffee (as described in Cedric Notredame, ""T-coffee: a novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequencealignment,"" 302(1) Journal of Molecular Biology 205 (September 2000), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference) was used to assess the alignment quality within the JACs and to calculate the alignment score.', 'The JOCs (orthologous protein families) can be highly conserved (having an alignment score of more than 950) or partially aligned with both conserved and variable regions (having an alignment score of about 300).  This result highlights theflexibility of the network-based aggregation algorithm used to recruit both highly similar and distantly related proteins without imposing a single similarity threshold.  A total of 617,127 JACs and 552,679 JOCs were generated, of which 177,684 JOCscontained at least two genes while the remaining 374,995 JOCs were singletons, indicating that 38.5% of all VOG proteins are unique.', 'To demonstrate the utility of VOGs, 32 proteins of the orthologous family encoding vaginolysin, a G. vaginalis cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that is key to its pathogenicity as it forms pores in epithelial cells, were retrieved.  Using theretrieved alignment, three amino acid variants in an 11-amino acid sequence of domain 4 of vaginolysin were identified.  One of the three variants, an alanine-to-valine substitution that is divergent across G. vaginalis, had not been reported previously. Thus, VOGs can be mined to understand biological relevance--in this case, potential differences in pore formation activity and possibly cytotoxicity, which can be further investigated and possibly exploited to formulate live biotherapeutics.  As anothernon-limiting example, VOGs were searched using the key phrase ""cell surface-associated proteins"" and ""L. iners"" and retrieved two protein families, one of which was recognized to have an LPXTG motif while the other harbored the motif YSIRK.  Notably, aprevious study on staphylococcal proteins suggested that the motifs LPXTG and YSIRK are involved in different biological processes related to surface protein anchoring to the cell wall envelope.  The two retrieved protein families are specific to L.iners and provide a relevant starting point for further investigation of its adherence and/or formulation of live biotherapeutics leveraging this difference.  These results demonstrate how a VOG database generated according to the present invention canbe used to explore and exploit more mechanistic understandings of vaginal bacterial communities.', 'Example 5: Integration of Metagenome and Metatranscriptome Data', 'This Example illustrates how reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention enable the characterization and integrative analysis of the abundance of genes and their expression in a microenvironment, in this case the vaginalmicroenvironment.', ""A female human subject's vaginal metagenomes and associated metatranscriptomes were analyzed at four time points: prior to (T1), during (T2 and T3), and after (T4) an episode of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis, as illustrated in FIG. 5A (thearrows represent, from left to right, the time points T1-T4).  Unsurprisingly, the expressed functions represented in the metatranscriptomes were often different from the encoded functional makeup of the corresponding metagenomes, as illustrated in FIG.5B.  VIRGO provided rapid binning of genes by species, which revealed dramatic differences in gene abundance and their transcriptional activity in vaginal species, as illustrated in FIG. 5C.  Prior to the episode of bacterial vaginosis (time point T1), asmall proportion (1.5%) of L. iners genes were present, but these genes exhibited high expression levels, accounting for over 20% of the metatranscriptome.  At the same time point, L. crispatus genes made up the majority of the genes present (96.3%) butexhibited low expression levels (34.2% of the metatranscriptome).  By contrast, near the end of the episode of bacterial vaginosis (time point T3), L. crispatus genes made up a small proportion of the metagenome but were highly transcriptionally active. This increased activity corresponded with L. crispatus regaining dominance at T4, following the resolution of the episode of bacterial vaginosis.  Notably, the functions encoded by G. vaginalis were similar between T2 and T3, but their expressiondiffered between these time points.  By enabling this integration of these types of data, reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can thus provide a functional understanding of the microbiota, e.g. the vaginal microbiota, andprovide insight into the formulation of appropriate live biotherapeutics for the treatment of a particular disease or disorder associated with specific metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic characteristics."", 'Example 6: Characterization of Within-Community Intraspecies Diversity', 'This Example illustrates how reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can be used to conduct intraspecies diversity analyses.', ""Intraspecies diversity analyses were conducted by mapping isolate genome sequences and vaginal metagenomes to VIRGO.  The analysis was focused on the seven vaginal species discussed in Example 2 above.  A total of 1,507 vaginal metagenomes,including 1,403 metagenomes newly obtained from de-identified vaginal swab and lavage specimens and 76 publicly available metagenomes, were mapped against VIRGO.  For each of the seven bacterial species, a presence/absence matrix for the species'non-redundant genes, including the data from the species' isolate genomes and all metagenomes that contained at least 80% of the average number of genes encoded on a genome of that species, was constructed.  Comparisons of the number of non-redundantgenes present in the species isolate genomes against the metagenomes in which they appeared were conducted using the student t-test.  Hierarchical clustering was performed on the Boolean matrix of the species' non-redundant genes using Jaccard clusteringimplemented in the vegan package in R."", ""The number of non-redundant genes identified in a metagenome was not found to correlate with the depth sequencing, as illustrated in FIG. 6.  Most of each species' gene content was recovered even when that species was present at low abundance(less than 1%) in a community.  For instance, even though P. timonensis was generally present in low abundance in these metagenomes (mean 4.8%, standard deviation 0.3%, minimum 0.1, maximum 33.8%), the majority of its genome was recovered (2,469.+-.401CDSs).  Similarly high sensitivity was observed in the analysis of the other six selected vaginal species.  These results demonstrate the capability of reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention to characterize the gene contentof even low-abundance taxa from metagenomics data."", 'Using these species-specific gene repertoires, the amount of intraspecies diversity present within an individual woman\'s vaginal microbiome can be characterized.  Because VIRGO (or another reference gene catalog of the invention) comprises the""pangenomes"" of each vaginal bacterial species, it can be used to evaluate the amount of intraspecies diversity present in microbiome communities.  The number of genes that were assigned to each of the seven species in each of the 1,507 metagenomicdatasets were counted and compared to the number of genes found in each species\' reference genome.  The number of genes for a species in a community often exceeded the number found in a single isolate genome, as illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B, suggestingthat multiple strains of a species co-occur in vaginal bacterial communities.  The total number of L. crispatus genes identified in each of the metagenomes where it was detected contained, on average, 1.6 times more genes (3,262.+-.586) than were foundencoded on L. crispatus genomes (2,064.+-.225, P<0.001).  Similar results were observed for G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, L. iners, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri.  Among these species, G. vaginalis and A. vaginae exhibited the highest degree of intraspeciesdiversity, while L. crispatus had the highest within-metagenome intraspecies diversity among the major Lactobacillus spp., as illustrated in FIG. 7A.  These results suggest that an individual woman\'s vaginal bacterial population routinely comprises morethan one strain of most species, and indicates that reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention enable the investigation of this intraspecies diversity and/or leveraging of such diversity to formulate live biotherapeutics.', 'Well-established practices from pangenomics, e.g. the procedures described in Herve Tettelin et al., ""Genome analysis of multiple pathogenic isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae: implications for the microbial `pan-genome,`"" 102(39) Proceedingsof the National Academy of Sciences 13950 (September 2005) (the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference), were applied to identify ""core"" and ""accessory"" non-redundant genes among the sample-specific species gene repertoires.  Based on theclustering patterns of gene prevalence profiles, groups of consistently present (""core"") and variably present (""accessory"") non-redundant genes could be defined.  The majority of the observed genes for each of the species were categorized as ""accessory,""with variable representation across the datasets.  Using L. crispatus as an example, more than twice as many non-redundant genes were observed to have variable representation across the metagenomes than were present in every sample, as illustrated inFIG. 7A.  Notably, it is clear from this analysis that the gene content identified with VIRGO in genome sequences of L. crispatus underrepresent the intraspecies genetic diversity present in the metagenomes.  Similar results were observed for the othersix species analyzed, although the magnitude of the difference between the metagenome and isolate gene repertoires varied depending on the species.  Overall, VIRGO revealed that metagenomic data carry a more extensive gene content than is found in allcombined isolate genome sequences.', 'Example 7: Metagenomic Subspecies in Vaginal Ecosystem', 'This Example illustrates how reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention can be used to identify metagenomic subspecies (""MG-subspecies"").', 'Hierarchical clustering of the metagenome species-specific gene content profiles revealed distinct groupings, defined herein as metagenomic subspecies or MG-subspecies.  These metagenomic subspecies represent types of bacterial populations thatshare a similar gene pool as assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequence data.  For example, this analysis revealed at least three distinct metagenomic subspecies for L. gasseri, as illustrated in FIG. 7B.  L. gasseri MG-subspecies I and III have large setsof non-redundant genes that are present in one but not the others, while L. gasseri MG-subspecies II carries a blend of the genes from both MG-subspecies I and III.  Analysis of G. vaginalis revealed at least five MG-subspecies, concordant with previousstudies that had identified multiple clades within the species.  However, it was also found that the genome-based paradigm largely underrepresents the diversity of G. vaginalis gene content that was identified in metagenomes.  The foregoing analysis wasapplied to seven vaginal species, and it was found that vaginal microbial communities are often composed of complex mixtures of multiple strains of the same species, and that these mixtures can be clustered into distinct MG-subspecies.  Reference genecatalogs generated according to the present invention thus enable investigation of MG-subspecies in the human microbiome and their gene contents, which in turn can reveal novel features of the microbiome and sub-populations thereof that allow for, e.g.,selection, tuning, and/or optimization of strains for use in live biotherapeutic formulations.', 'Example 8: Gene-Specific Effect of Microbial Species on Microbiome Health', 'This Example illustrates the use of reference gene catalogs generated according to the present invention to formulate live biotherapeutics.', 'The use of VIRGO revealed a stability pattern of the microbiota from which isolates of Lactobacillus crispatus were cultured.  Specifically, using a DBGWAS method (as described in Magali Jaillard et al., ""A fast and agnostic method for bacterialgenome-wide association studies: bridging the gap between k-mers and genetic events,"" 14(11) PLoS Genetics e1007758 (November 2018), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference) in conjunction with VIRGO, it was discovered that sequencevariants of the asparagine synthase B (asnB) gene of L. crispatus were strongly associated with stability of L. crispatus in the vaginal environment, as illustrated in FIG. 8.', 'Metabolomics have indicated that asparagine synthase can synthesize asparagine from aspartate and glutamine (in which case glutamate is also produced) and/or from aspartate and ammonia.  As has been demonstrated previously, e.g. in Pybus, twopathogenic bacteria (G. vaginalis and P. bivia) associated with bacterial vaginosis and other adverse health outcomes (e.g. inflammation, preterm birth, increased risk of STI) rely on an ammonia-based cycle to flourish in the vaginal environment.  Thus,the ability of L. crispatus to sequester ammonia in the vagina may break this cycle and slow or prevent the growth of G. vaginalis and P. bivia.  Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the identified sequence variantsin the asnB gene of L. crispatus may affect glutamine binding and thus production of asparagine by the ammonia sequestration mechanism, thereby preventing the growth of the pathogenic species and resulting in a more stable vaginal environment.', 'In addition to G. vaginalis and P. bivia, another common pathogen in the vaginal environment is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC).  UPEC causes 80% of all UTI, which affects over ten million women in the United States alone each year, ishighly recurrent, and is often highly antibiotic-resistant.  UPEC is known to reside in the intestinal tract, but also in the vaginal tract, where it can infect the urethra and ultimately the bladder.  Recurrent UTI is an unaddressed healthcare need, andlive biotherapeutics that are effective against UPEC are therefore highly desirable.', 'Three strains of L. crispatus having the stability-associated asnB gene (identified herein as LUCA015, LUCA011, and LUCA09) were parallel streak assayed against UPEC, clinical P. bivia, and clinical G. vaginalis on MRS agar+1% starch.  After 24hours, the inhibiting effects of each strain against each pathogen were scored.  The results of the assay are given in Table 2.', 'TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 E. coli P. bivia G. vaginalis CFT073 C0046E2 C0047B2 L. crispatus LUCA015 +++ +++ +++ L. crispatus LUCA011 +++ +++ +++ L. crispatus LUCA009 +++ +++ +++ Legend: - = no apparent inhibition; + = about 25% inhibition; ++ =about 50% inhibition; +++ = about 75% inhibition; ++++ = apparently complete inhibition', 'These results indicate that the effectiveness of live biotherapeutic formulations can be greatly enhanced by gene-specific selection of bacterial strains included in the live biotherapeutic formulation.', 'Example 9: Formulation of Gene-Specific Live Biotherapeutic', 'This Example further investigates the antimicrobial effect of particular L. crispatus strains on common vaginal pathogens.', 'Using the techniques described herein, nine strains of L. crispatus were identified as having a stability-associated asnB sequence variant, as described in the preceding Example.

However, in order to prevent more mutations, Dpo4 needs to be removed immediately after crossing the lesion and the normal replicative polymerase restores control of DNA synthesis afterwards, which requires that the binding of Dpo4 to DNA is transient. Dpo4 is a typical Y-family DNA polymerase with a typical right-hand structure, which is divided into four domains: a thumb domain, a palm domain, a finger domain, and a little-finger domain.  Compared to other DNA polymerases, Dpo4 has a small fingerdomain, resulting in almost no contact with the major groove of the nascent base pair.  Its thumb domain is short and thick, making Dpo4 less effective at binding to DNA and incorporating of nucleosides.  Thus Dpo4 imposes few constraints on its DNAsubstrate.  Its structural characteristics and lesser functional requirements of its DNA substrate makes Dpo4 have a low processivity in DNA synthesis.', 'The essence of processivity is to retain the affinity of the enzyme to the polymeric substrate during multiple rounds of catalysis.  Therefore, increasing the affinity of the polymerase to the substrate is the essential way to increase theprocessivity.  In the existing studies, the polymerase processivity was mainly increased by linking corresponding binding proteins, such as the .beta.-slip gripper, thioredoxin, PCNA and the Sso7d protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus, to the polymerase. The research on enhancing the affinity of polymerase and DNA by mutating amino acids is mainly reported in the research of reverse transcriptases of some HIV viruses, and there are few studies on mutating Y-family DNA polymerases to enhance theiraffinity to DNA.', 'SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'The present invention aims to provide a Dpo4 DNA-polymerase mutant with increased processivity, which is obtained by mutating amino acid A at the 181st position of the wild-type Dpo4 to D (Dpo4 A181D), or E at the 63rd position to K (Dpo4 E63K)by site-directed mutagenesis.', 'The processivity refers to the average extension length of the DNA caused by the DNA polymerase binding to the DNA once.', 'The amino acid A at the 181st position and the amino acid E at the 63rd position are both non-conserved sites.', 'A nucleotide sequence encoding wild-type Dpo4 is shown in SEQ ID NO:1, and an amino acid sequence of the wild-type Dpo4 is shown in SEQ ID NO:2.', 'The present invention provides a method for obtaining the Dpo4 DNA polymerase mutants with increased processivity, comprising searching for candidate mutation sites by simulating the binding energy of Dpo4 and DNA by means of molecular dynamicsand obtaining the enzyme mutants by site-directed mutagenesis.', 'The present invention provides mutants of a Dpo4 derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus that has increased DNA processivity as compared to the wild-type enzyme.  In terms of the processivity, the extension length of the Dpo4 A181D is increased by25%, and the extension length of the Dpo4 E63K is increased by 18.8% as compared with the wild-type Dpo4.  The fidelity of Dpo4 A181D is close to that of Dpo4, and the fidelity of Dpo4 E63K is increased as compared with that of Dpo4.  In general, themutants A181D and E63K obtained by the present invention have increased processivity.', 'BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS', 'FIG. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE of proteins during steps of expression and purification of Dpo4 protein.

The examples are described only for illustration purpose, notto limit the scope of the present invention which is defined by the claims hereafter.', 'Example 1.  Expression and Purification of Dpo4 Protein', 'The Dpo4 target gene with the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 was synthesized by', 'Synbio', 'Technologies (Suzhou, China) and was subjected to enzyme digestion and ligation to construct a recombinant plasmid pET28a-dpo4.  The recombinant plasmidpET28a-dpo4 was transformed into an E. coli BL21 strain for expression of Dpo4 protein.  The pET28a contains a Histidine tag.  The expressed protein was first purified through a Ni-NTA gravity column, and then purified through a cation exchange columnMono-S until only single protein band is detectable.  The purity of the target protein was determined by SDS-PAGE.  The purified Dpo4 protein was stored at -80.degree.  C. in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 50%glycerol (v/v) (pH 7.7 when measured at 22.degree.  C.).  The results of expression and purification of protein are shown in FIG. 1.  It was shown from the lanes 2 and 3 that E. coli BL21 expressed Dpo4 only after ITPG induction and did not havebackground expression.  As shown in lane 5, after two steps of purification, only a single band of the target protein is detectable in the SDS-PAGE.', 'Example 2.  Determination of Dpo4 Mutation Sites', 'By homologous sequence comparison, the non-conserved sites in the Dpo4 sequence and the mutation direction and frequency of these sites were determined.  The results are shown in Table 1.  Ten mutation directions of F33Y, F37T, I59M, E63K, M76I,A181D, N188S, A220S, I248Y, and V289I were determined, and the binding of the ten Dpo4 mutants to DNA and the binding free energy were simulated by the computer.  The results are shown in Table 2.  Theoretically, the decrease in binding free energy leadsto more stable binding between the enzyme and the substrate, resulting in the higher affinity between the enzyme and the substrate and thus increased processivity of the enzyme.

The nucleotide sequence encoding the wild-type Dpo4 isas shown in SEQ ID NO:1, and the amino acid sequence of the wild-type Dpo4 is as shown in SEQ ID NO:2.', 'The processivity of Dpo4 and ten mutant enzymes was evaluated by primer extension assays.  A constant concentration (10 nM) of annealed fluorescently labeled primer/template was added to a reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl,10 mM MgCl.sub.2, 200 mM dNTPs, 1 mM DTT, 100 .mu.g/ml BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100).  100 nM Dpo4 or mutant enzymes was added to initiate DNA synthesis at 37.degree.  C., and a 50-mer single-stranded sequence 5000 times more than the substrate was used asa Trap to ensure that the enzyme is bound to DNA only once.  After incubation for 5 min, 10 .mu.L of stop solution (80% formamide, 1 mg/mL xylene C, 1 mg/mL bromophenol blue, 20 mM EDTA) was added for quenching the primer extension reaction.  Thereaction product was denatured at 95.degree.  C. for 5 minutes, and placed on ice for 10 min. The reaction mixture was separated on 20% Urea-PAGE and the gel was scanned by Typhoon Trio.  The results are shown in FIG. 2.', 'The processivity of a DNA polymerase is defined as the average extension band length under the condition that the DNA polymerase is allowed to bind to the DNA template only once.  As shown in FIG. 2A, the content of the main bands of Dpo4 andthe mutant enzyme-directed extensions were significantly different.  Based on relative fluorescence of each band of the extension products of Dpo4 or the mutant enzymes, the average extension length was calculated as weighted average length of all theextension bands for each enzyme, and used as a measure of the processivity for that enzyme.', 'Using this method, the processivity of the wild-type Dpo4 is found to be 16 nt.  In the existing literature, the extension length of wild-type Dpo4 was reported to be about 50-100 nt when the enzyme was 20 times more than DNA and the extensionassay was performed in the absence of Trap sequences.  The higher number reported is likely because of the usage of higher amount of enzyme and multiple times of bindings between the enzyme and the DNA due to lack of Trap sequences.  Under the presentcondition, when the Trap sequences are added and Dpo4 is only 10 times more than the DNA template, the processivity of Dpo4 is measured to be 16 nt.', 'The average extended band length of all mutants was calculated according to the same method used for the wild-type Dpo4 (FIG. 2B).  As compared with the wild-type Dpo4, the extension length of Dpo4A181D and Dpo4E63K was increased by 25% and18.75%, respectively.  The extension length of Dpo4 V289I, Dpo4 A220S, Dpo4 M76I and Dpo4 F37T was decreased, wherein the Dpo4 V289I has the most significant decrease of 18.75% as compared to that of the wild-type Dpo4.  The rest of the Dpo4 mutants havesimilar processivity to that of the wild-type Dpo4.  The results of the processivity of the mutants indicated that the mutants with increased binding energy could increase the processivity of Dpo4, and the mutants with decreased binding energy exhibitedlower processivity than that of the wild-type Dpo4.', 'In summary, the processivity of Dpo4E63K, Dpo4N118S, Dpo4A181D and Dpo4I248Y is increased while the processivity of Dpo4F37T, I59M, Dpo4M76I, Dpo4A220S and Dpo4V289I is decreased, and the Dpo4F33Y and Sdbh I62V mutations had no effect on theprocessivity, indicating that molecular dynamics simulation methods can play a predictive role to a certain extent.', 'Example 4.  Comparison of the Fidelity of Dpo4 and the Mutant Enzymes', 'The Dpo4 A181D and Dpo4 E63K with a significant increase in processivity and Dpo4 V289I with the most significant decrease in processivity were compared with the wild-type Dpo4 in terms of the fidelity in the presence of Mn.sup.2+.  The primerextensions of the four templates, T.sub.A, T.sub.T, T.sub.G and T.sub.C (see Table 3), were performed with either a single base (dATP, dCTP, dGTP or dTTP) or a four-base mixture (dNTPs).  A 20 nM annealed primer/template was added to a reaction buffer(10 mM HEPES NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl.sub.2, 200 mM dNTPs, 1 mM DTT, 100 .mu.g/ml BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100).  10 nM DNA polymerase was added to initiate DNA synthesis at 37.degree.  C. After incubation for 2 hr, 10 .mu.L of stop solutionwas added to quench the reaction.  The reaction product was separated by 20% Urea-PAGE, and the gel was quantitated using a Typhoon 9400 scanner and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, USA).', 'The results are as shown in FIG. 3.  Correct nucleotides were well incorporated by Dpo4 and mutants for all of the four templates (see FIG. 3A-3B).  However, there was a significant difference among Dpo4 and mutant enzymes in the terms ofmismatched nucleotide incorporation.  The ratio of mismatched incorporation is higher for wtDpo4 and A181D than for E63K and V289I.  From the statistical analysis of mismatched cases (FIG. 3C), Dpo4 and A181D had significantly more types and amount ofmismatched extensions than that of E63K and V289I.  The fidelity of A181D and wtDpo4 is quite similar under tested condition with Mn.sup.2+.', 'The incorporation rate is calculated as follows.  A Cy3-labeled 15-mer primer was annealed to a 50-mer DNA template and was subjected to be extended by wtDpo4 or one of its mutant enzymes in the presence of a single nucleotide or a mixture ofthe four nucleotides.  If there are extended products, more than one fluorescent bands can detected; if no extension occurs, only the primer band can be detected.  The extension reaction products were separated by a 20% Urea-PAGE, and the gel wasquantitated using a Typhoon 9400 scanner and ImageQuant software.  Nucleotide incorporation was calculated using the following equation:', '.times..times..times.  ##EQU00001## where I.sub.s=intensity of the extension band and I.sub.p=intensity of the primer band in the same lane.', 'When using T.sub.A as the template, the incorporation rate of nucleotide dATP was about 80%.  When using T.sub.T as the template, the incorporation rate of dTTP for Dpo4 was 88.4%, while that of Dpo4A181D was only 67.4%.  However, when usingT.sub.G as the template, A181D has more mismatches than that of Dpo4.  The incorporation rates of dATP, dTTP and dGTP for A181D were respectively 73.2%, 60.9%, and 63.1%, while the incorporation rates for Dpo4 were only 64.9%, 59.5% and 46.7%,respectively.', 'Therefore, the mis-incorporation rate of A181D was higher than that of Dpo4, and its fidelity was lower than that of Dpo4.  The mis-incorporation rate of dTTP for Dpo4 E63K reached 80% only when the template was T.sub.T, and themis-incorporation rate was lower than 60% under all other mismatched conditions.  The mis-incorporation rate of V289I was 67.58% when dGTP was incorporated into the template T.sub.A, which was the maximum mis-incorporation rate for V289I.', 'Based on the statistical analysis of mismatched cases, the fidelity of A181D and wtDpo4 are similar.  The fidelity of E63K is higher than that of Dpo4 and Dpo4A181D, and mutant V289I has the least mismatches and the highest fidelity.  The orderof fidelity from high to low is: V289I, E63K, Dpo4, and A181D, suggesting that the increase of the processivity is not necessarily related to the change of fidelity.', ""TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Primers and template sequences used in fidelity experiments Template/ Primer Sequence (5'-3') Primer 5'-Cy3-CGTACTCGTAGGCAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 3) T.sub.G 5'- TCCTACCGTGCCTACCTGAACAGCTGGTCACACTGATGCC TACGAGTACG -3' (SEQ IDNO:4) T.sub.A 5'- TCCTACCGTGCCTACCTGAACAGCTGGTCACACTAATGCC TACGAGTACG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 5) T.sub.C 5'- TCCTACCGTGCCTACCTGAACAGCTGGTCACACTCATGCC TACGAGTACG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 6) T.sub.T 5'- TCCTACCGTGCCTACCTGAACAGCTGGTCACACTTATGCC TACGAGTACG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 7)"", 'Example 5.  Comparison of Nucleotide Incorporation Efficiency of Dpo4 and Mutant Enzymes', 'To compare the nucleotide incorporation efficiency of Dpo4 and mutant proteins is to compare the difference in pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation among Dpo4 and mutant proteins.  A 30 nM (50-mer/15-mer) primer extensionreaction was initiated with addition of 120 nM Dpo4 or mutant proteins.  After different periods of time, the DNA polymerization was terminated by EDTA.  The product was separated in a 20% polyacrylamide gel, and the concentration of the extensionproducts was obtained by Typhoon quantitative analysis.  The reaction rate constant (K.sub.obs) under a specific dNTP concentration was calculated according to the formula [product]=A(1-exp(-K.sub.obst)).', 'By varying the concentration (20-400 .mu.M) of dNTP, the SPSS non-linear fitting equation of K.sub.obs and dNTP (FIG. 4) K.sub.obs=K.sub.p[dNTP]/{[dNTP]+K.sub.d,dNTP} was used to calculate the maximum nucleotide incorporation rate K.sub.p andthe equilibrium dissociation constant K.sub.d,dNTP, thereby calculating the corresponding nucleotide incorporation efficiency (K.sub.p/K.sub.d, dNTP).', 'As can be seen from Table 4, the nucleotide incorporation rates (K.sub.p) of A181D and E63K are respectively 1.8 and 2.6 times that of wtDpo4, and K.sub.d,dNTP of A181D and E63K are respectively 1.7 and 3 times that of wtDpo4.  As a result,there is little difference in terms of nucleotide incorporation efficiency for these three enzymes.  The nucleotide incorporation efficiency of Dpo4V289I is 45.9% lower than that of the wild-type Dpo4.  This lower nucleotide incorporation efficiency mayexplain why V289I has better fidelity than wtDpo4 and other mutants.  K.sub.d,dNTP reflects the binding affinity of the ground state for correct nucleotide incorporation, indicating the strength of interaction of Dpo4 and adjacent base pairs.', 'According to the results, the K.sub.d,dNTP of the two mutants A181D and E63K with increased processivity had weaker binding affinity than that of the wtDpo4, possibly because the increase of the processivity of the mutants requires theenzyme-DNA-dNTP complex to switch from the ""open state"" to the ""closed state"" faster.  This process requires a conformational change in the finger and LF regions of Dpo4, which attenuates the interaction between dNTP and Dpo4, making the interactionbetween Dpo4 and the duplicated base pair more loose, resulting in an increase in K.sub.d,dNTP value.  The lower processivity of Dpo4V289I, on the other hand, corresponds to stronger ground state affinity of the enzyme and DNA and dNTP.', 'In summary, the nucleotide incorporation efficiency of the two mutants A181D and E63K was similar to that of Dpo4 while the nucleotide incorporation efficiency of Dpo4V289I was greatly reduced.  A181D and E63K had no effect on the nucleotideincorporation efficiency while the two mutants have increased the processivity.', 'TABLE-US-00004 TABLE 4 Analysis of nucleotide incorporation efficiency of Dpo4 and mutant enzymes Equilibrium Nucleotide Maximum Dissociation Incorporation Reaction Rate Constant Efficiency Mutant (S.sup.-1) (.mu.M) (S.sup.-1 .mu.M.sup.-1) Dpo40.066 .+-.  0.009 142.38 .+-.  18.36 4.64 .times.  10.sup.-4 Dpo4A181D 0.12 .+-.  0.004 243.09 .+-.  41.19 4.94 .times.  10.sup.-4 Dpo4E63K 0.177 .+-.  0.003 432.52 .+-.  10.76 4.09 .times.  10.sup.-4 Dpo4V289I 0.021 .+-.  0.004 83.65 .+-.  5.81 2.51.times.  10.sup.-4', 'While the present invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, one skilled in the art will appreciate that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of theinvention.

In addition, low concentration of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water is identified as a major cause of stress, poor appetite, slow growth, disease susceptibility and mortality in aquatic animals.  Normally, the dissolved oxygenneeds to be maintained at a concentration of 4 to 8 mg/L for fish farming, and at a concentration of 6 to 8 mg/L for shrimp farming.', 'Conventional methods to improve dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water include: (1) mechanical aeration using aerators to mix air and the aquaculture water so that oxygen can be absorbed into the water; and (2) chemical oxygenation using anoxygenating agent (such as sodium peroxide and calcium peroxide) to treat the aquaculture water so as to generate oxygen.  However, the use of aerators in the process of mechanical aeration requires massive power consumption that may incur a highoperating cost.  On the other hand, the use of oxygenating agents could generate metal ions that increase the pH value of the aquaculture water, resulting in adverse health effects to the aquatic animals.  Therefore, researchers in this field haveattempted to develop safe and low-cost methods to increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in aquaculture water.', 'Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gram-positive bacteria that produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation.  These bacteria, which are usually found in pickled food, dairy products, and intestinal tract mucosaof animals, share common physiological characteristics, including rod-shaped (bacilli) or spherical (cocci), catalase-negative, devoid of cytochrome, non-sporulating and non-motile.', 'Lactic acid bacteria are conferred with the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, and are widely used as probiotics.

SONG et al. (2003), Freshwater Fisheries, 43:1-8, R. SONG et al. found that Lactobacillus casei L821a is capable of promoting nitrite degradation in the aquaculture water by virtue of intracellular enzymolysis and also bydirect chemical reaction of its metabolite (i.e., lactic acid) and the resulting indirect effect of the lactic acid to promote microbial denitrification.', 'In a previous study, the applicants found that a mixture including Lactobacillus plantarum LP28 (BCRC 910435), Pediococcus pentosaceus PP4012 (BCRC 910480), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei and Bacillussubtilis is capable of improving gastrointestinal tract function, immunity, feed conversion rate and growth rate of aquatic fish and shrimps.

Field of the Invention', 'The present invention relates to use of Lactobacillus plantarum composition for manufacturing anti-fatigue probiotic composition, in particular to reduce exercise fatigue and improve exercise performance.', '2.  Description of the Prior Art', ""Lactobacillus plantarum is a gram-positive bacterium that can be found in fermented food or animal's saliva.  It has the largest genome in lactic acid bacteria.  Therefore, Lactobacillus plantarum has many variations and so has manyapplications."", 'Previously studies reported that Lactobacillus plantarum has many medical applications, including regulation of inflammation-related diseases, protection of viral infection in respiratory tracts, reduction of accumulation in fatty liver, andincreasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to the medicine mixed with Lactobacillus plantarum.  In addition, Lactobacillus plantarum can be used for a variety of food additives.  For example, it can be used to prevent the growth of poisonous fungi forcorns.', 'Physiologic fatigue can be classified as muscle fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, and central nervous fatigue.  The muscle fatigue can be caused by a large amount of exercise, resulting in motor function reduction, muscle contractilityreduction, and exercise nerve retardation.', 'However, the study of the fatigue has its difficulties, because the fatigue is a complex physiological interaction and responses of human body structures.  Thus, how to reduce fatigue is also the goal of the researchers in this field toaccomplish.', 'Regarding the myriad of factors that can cause fatigue, creatine is an important physiological factor.  The role of creatine kinase is to catalyze creatine and phosphocreatine conversion between each other, and to release ATP to provide energyduring exercise.  It is largely caused by skeletal muscle or myocardial exercise, but low probability caused by smooth muscle.  The main reason that the concentration of creatine kinase in blood changes is exercise.  After exercising, the release ofcreatine kinase into blood will increase for up to a week.  A high concentration of creatine kinase may be a sign of muscle cell damage.  The associated diseases include rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction, myositis, or myocarditis.', ""The creatinine concentration decreasing in blood usually does not have any clinical significance, but it may reflect a low amount of muscle exercise or sedentary work and lifestyle.  Resting in bed will lead to decrease activity of CK more than20%.  Supplementation of creatine has long been recognized as a viable option for treatment of muscular, neurogenic or neuromuscular disorders, including arthritis, chronic congestive heart failure, wasted atrophy, ring atrophy, muscle phosphorylasedeficiency, Huntington's disease, neuromuscular disorders, mitochondrial disorders, muscular dystrophy, and neuroprotection."", 'So far, there are a number of prior arts disclose pharmaceutical compositions to reduce the fatigue.

Thus, long-term LP10supplementation could benefit the muscle explosive force when no training protocol is implemented.  Thus, LP10 could increase in muscle mass and forelimb grip strength.', 'The swim-to-exhaustion test is used to examine exercise performance ability.

Lactate accumulates in the blood and in the muscles engaged in the exercise and exceeds the aerobic metaboliccapacity.  When the lactic acid concentration increases, hydrogen ions accumulate, which leads to fatigue due to acidification.', 'The effect of LP10 supplementation on fatigue-associated biochemical indices was evaluated after exercise.

In the trend analysis, serum lactate level was dose-dependently decreased with increasing LP10 dose (p<0.0001).  LP10 supplementation may have potential for the removal and utilization of blood lactate after exercise.', 'Ammonia, another important metabolite produced during energy metabolism for exercise, is generated by different sources.

Trend analysis revealed that LP10treatment had a significant dose-dependent effect on CK level (p=0.0118).  Therefore, LP10 supplementation could ameliorate skeletal muscle injury induced by acute exercise challenge.', 'BUN is an important biochemical parameter related to fatigue.  The BUN level is used to measure the amount of nitrogen in blood from the waste product of urea.  Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds. Consequently, an increased BUN level reflects the decomposition of protein, which will adversely affect the contractive strength of muscle and lead to fatigue.  Serum BUN level did not differ among treatment groups (FIG. 3E).', 'Above all, LP10 may have potential as an ergogenic supplement by improving gut microbiota and regulating energy utilization.

After six-week supplementation with LP10, the final BW was lowerwith LP10-1X and LP10-5X, by 7.47% (p=0.0003) and 3.46% (p=0.0567), respectively, than with vehicle treatment.  In addition, daily intake of diet and water increased in LP10-5X fed mice.  Trend analysis showed that daily intake of diet (p<0.0001) andwater (p<0.0001) dose-dependently increased with LP10 supplementation, so daily diet intake was increased but BW was decreased.  In addition, BW was significantly lower (p<0.05) with vehicle treatment at Week 3 of LP10 supplementation (FIG. 4). Thus, three-week LP10 supplementation may change the body composition and energy utilization.', 'We measured the effect of LP10 on the muscle and epididymal fat pad (EFP) mass and relative tissue weight (different tissue weights adjusted for individual BW %).  The EFP weight was lower by 34.62% (p=0.003) and 50.30% (p<0.0001) withLP10-1X and LP10-5X, respectively, than with vehicle treatment.  Trend analysis showed that EFP weight dose-dependently decreased with LP10 supplementation (p<0.0001).  The relative weight of EFP (%) was lower by 28.93% (p=0.0048) and 48.22%(p<0.0001) with LP10-1X and LP10-5X, respectively, than with vehicle treatment.', 'The relative weight (%) of muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles) was greater by 1.10 (p=0.0003) and 1.07 folds (p=0.0098) with LP10-1X and LP10-5X, respectively, than with vehicle treatment.  Trend analysis also showed a significantdose-dependent decrease and increase in relative EFP weight (%) and relative muscle weight (%), respectively, with LP10 supplementation.

The present invention also relates to methods of using the compositions comprising synthetic nucleic acidsfor genetic engineering in human beings and other mammals BACKGROUND', 'Genome editing has offered a powerful tool and unprecedented opportunity to study gene functions and to fight diseases by introducing a targeted genomic sequence change at a specific locus of a living cell or organism.  Zinc finger nucleases(ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) nucleases are the ones that have been used successfully and efficiently by many laboratories.  Morerecently, the RNA-guided endonucleases such as Cas9 and Cpf1 have gained more traction because of their relatively ease of manipulation.  The user-friendly CRISPR-Cas9 is very efficient in making mutations via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in humancancer cell lines such as 293T cells.  It also can mediate homologous recombination (HR), but at a much lower efficiency (2-5%) in 293T cells and even lower in other biologically relevant cells such as human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).', 'Recently, it has been reported that it is feasible to achieve genome editing by using Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) with a guide DNA oligo in human cells (Gao F, et al., (2016) Nat Biotechnol.  34(7):768-73).  However, multiplelabs have failed to reproduce this phenomenon claimed by Gao et al. thus far, which led to the withdrawal of this publication.  Interestingly, an eye defect was observed by using an NgAgo approach in zebrafish.  The phenotype was most likely caused by anNgAgo mediated gene knockdown effect, and no genetic modification was observed at the DNA level.', ""Argonautes use an orthogonal mechanism of immune surveillance and promise an entirely novel process for gene editing.  Argonautes are a family of endonucleases that use 5' phosphorylated short single-stranded nucleic acids as guides to cleavetargets.  Similar to Cas9 and Cpf1, Argonautes play key roles in gene expression repression and host defense against foreign nucleic acids.  While Cas9 and Cpf1 are only naturally found in prokaryotes, members of Argonaute superfamily are reported to bepresent in many species (from bacteria to mammals).  Although most Argonautes associate with single-stranded (ss) RNAs and play a central role in RNA silencing, some Argonautes bind ssDNAs and cleave target DNAs.  It appears that DNA-guided Argonautebinding does not have a specific requirement for sequence or secondary structure.  Argonautes are conserved throughout the bacterial and archaeal domains of living organisms.  Their major functions are likely to be involved in DNA-guided DNA-interferinghost defense systems."", 'An ideal gene editing tool should be able to introduce a desired base change, deletion or insertion into the genome in a precise, non-bias and error-free manner.  Although CRISPR/Cas systems, originally derived from a bacterial host defensemechanism, are versatile and are currently widely used, they are error-prone and sequence-biased.', 'SUMMARY', 'Disclosed herein are several novel codon-adapted Argonaute protein variants named ANAGO that are derived from microbial Argonaute proteins capable of editing a target nucleic acid sequence within a prokaryotic cell.

Non-limiting examples of mammals include humans, non-humanprimates (e.g., apes, gibbons, chimpanzees, orangutans, monkeys, macaques, and the like), domestic animals (e.g., dogs and cats), farm animals (e.g., horses, cows, goats, sheep, and pigs) and experimental animal models (e.g., Drosophila, zebra fish,Xenopus, chick, mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and pig).  In some embodiments a mammal is a human.  A mammal can be any age or at any stage of development (e.g., an adult, teen, child, infant, or a mammal in utero).  A mammal can be male or female.  Amammal can be a pregnant female.  In certain embodiments, a mammal can be an animal disease model.  In some embodiments, the subject is human.  In some embodiments, the subject is an animal.  In some embodiments, the subject is a plant.', 'The term ""ANAGO"" refers to a codon-Adapted Nuclear Argonaute protein.  ANAGO is an Argonaute protein variant derived from a microorganism having DNA endonuclease activities.  The DNA coding sequences of a microbial Argonaute protein that has DNAendonuclease activities in microorganisms, such as but not limited to, natronobacterium gregoryi [NgAgo], Pyrococcus furiosus [PfAgo], Thermus thermophilus [TtAgo], Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [MjAgo], Clostridium butyricum [CbAgo], or Limnothrix rosea[LrAgo], etc., can be reengineered and adapted with the codons that are most frequently used (with high usage frequency) or have preferential usage in the cells of a eukaryotic species of interest to generate a new synthetic nucleic acid sequence thatencodes an ANAGO, that is species-specific to the eukaryotic species.  When expressed in a cell in the eukaryotic species, this ANAGO conserves and/or retains an ability to edit a target nucleic acid sequence within the eukaryotic cell.  For example,when the most frequently used codons in human cells are used to replace the microbial preferred codons (referring herein to ""reengineering"" or ""adapting"") of a DNA coding sequence of a microbial argonaute protein to generate a new synthetic nucleic acid,which encodes an ANAGO, this type of ANAGO is called human ANAGO.  Likewise, when the most frequently used codons or preferentially utilized codons in dog cells are used for reengineering a DNA coding sequence of microbial argonaute protein to generate anew synthetic nucleic acid, which encodes an ANAGO, this type of ANAGO is called dog ANAGO.  When the most frequently used codons in plants are used for reengineering a DNA coding sequence of a microbial Argonaute protein to generate a new syntheticnucleic acid, which encodes an ANAGO, this type of ANAGO is called plant ANAGO.', 'The term ""ANAGO"" can refer to a protein or to a nucleic acid encoding the protein.  For example, when a messenger RNA comprising a synthetic nucleic acid sequence comprises a coding region that encodes an ANAGO in a protein form, the messengerRNA can be called ""ANAGO RNA"".  The DNA comprising the synthetic nucleic acid sequence that transcribes the ANAGO RNA can be called ""ANAGO DNA"".  For example, an ANAGO can be an in vitro transcribed messenger RNA.  An ANAGO can be cloned into a mammalianexpression vector before being introduced into a eukaryotic cell.  For example, a human ANAGO in a form of a protein, or an in vitro transcribed messenger RNA, is cloned into a mammalian expression vector before being introduced into a human cell.  Theexpression vector can be a plasmid, a lentiviral vector, an adeno-associated viral vector, or any viral vector.', 'The name ANAGO is used both in singular or plural with the all letters always capitalized.

For, example, a nucleic acid may be an amplicon.  A nucleic acid may be from a nucleic acidlibrary, such as a gDNA, cDNA or RNA library, for example.  A nucleic acid can be synthesized (e.g., chemically synthesized) or generated (e.g., by polymerase extension in vitro, e.g., by amplification, e.g., by PCR).

Primers are often configured to hybridize to a selected complementary nucleic acid and are configured to be extended by a polymerase afterhybridizing.', 'A genome refers to the genetic material of a cell, a virus, or an organism.  The genetic material of a cell or organism often comprises one or more genes.  In certain embodiments a gene comprises or consists of one or more nucleic acids.  Theterm ""gene"" means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain and can include coding regions (e.g., exons), regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) involved in the transcription/translation of the geneproduct and the regulation of the transcription/translation, as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).  A gene may not necessarily produce a peptide or may produce a truncated or non-functional protein due togenetic variation in a gene sequence (e.g., mutations in coding and non-coding portions of a gene).  For example, a non-functional gene can be a pseudogene.  A gene may also produce a non-coding RNA, such as long non-coding RNA (IncRNA); microRNA(miRNA); small interfering RNA (siRNA); Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs); or small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and other short RNA (Ma L, Bajic V B, and Zhang Z, ""On the classification of long non-coding RNAs"", RNA Biology.  10 (6): 925-33, June 2013).  A gene,whether functional or non-functional, can often be identified by homology to a gene in a reference genome.  For example, any specific gene (e.g., a gene of interest, a counterpart gene, a pseudogene and the like) of a subject can be identified in anothersubject, genome or in a reference genome by one of skill in the art.  In a diploid subject, a gene often comprises a pair of alleles (e.g., two alleles).  Thus, a method, system or process herein can be applied to one or both alleles of a gene.  In someembodiments a method, system or process herein is applied to each allele of a gene.', 'The term ""percent identical"" or ""percent identity"" refers to sequence identity between two amino acid sequences.  Identity can be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison.  When anequivalent position in the compared sequences is occupied by the same amino acid, then the molecules are identical at that position.  When the equivalent site is occupied by the same or a similar amino acid residue (e.g., similar in steric and/orelectronic nature), then the molecules can be referred to as homologous (similar) at that position.  Expression as a percentage of homology, similarity, or identity refers to a function of the number of identical or similar amino acids at positionsshared by the compared sequences.  Expression as a percentage of homology, similarity, or identity refers to a function of the number of identical or similar amino acids at positions shared by the compared sequences.  Various alignment algorithms and/orprograms may be used, including FASTA, BLAST, or ENTREZ.  FASTA and BLAST are available as a part of the GCG sequence analysis package (University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), and can be used with, e.g., default settings.  ENTREZ is available throughthe National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.  In one embodiment, the percent identity of two sequences can be determined by the GCG program with a gap weight of 1, e.g.,each amino acid gap is weighted as if it were a single amino acid or nucleotide mismatch between the two sequences.', 'Other techniques for alignment are described in Methods in Enzymology, vol. 266: Computer Methods for Macromolecular Sequence Analysis (1996), ed.  Doolittle, Academic Press, Inc., a division of Harcourt Brace & Co., San Diego, Calif., USA.  Insome embodiments an alignment program that permits gaps in the sequence is utilized to align the sequences.  The Smith-Waterman is one type of algorithm that permits gaps in sequence alignments.  See Meth.  Mol. Biol.  70:173-187 (1997).  Also, the GAPprogram using the Needleman and Wunsch alignment method can be utilized to align sequences.  An alternative search strategy uses MPSRCH software, which runs on a MASPAR computer.  MPSRCH uses a Smith-Waterman algorithm to score sequences on a massivelyparallel computer.  This approach improves ability to pick up distantly related matches; and is especially tolerant of small gaps and nucleotide sequence errors.  Nucleic acid-encoded amino acid sequences can be used to search both protein and DNAdatabases.', 'In some embodiments a nucleic acid described herein comprises a label.  As used herein, the terms ""label"" or ""labeled"" refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to apolypeptide of biotin moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods).

Any number of nucleotides within a targetsequence may be deleted, mutated or replaced, for example by a desired sequence (e.g., an insert sequence of a donor sequence).  In some embodiments, one or more nucleotides or a desired sequence are inserted into a target sequence by a method describedherein.  In certain embodiments, a target sequence provides a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary or identical to a guide oligonucleotide, or portion thereof, for example when the guide oligonucleotide is used in an experiment for comparisonpurpose as described below.  In certain embodiments a target sequence provides a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary or identical to a 5' and/or 3' flanking regions of a donor sequence."", ""Although a guide oligonucleotide is not needed in the ANAGO induced gene editing technology, a guide molecule was used in some of the experiments described in FIG. 2b and FIG. 4b, solely for comparing the results in the experiment where a guidemolecule was not used.  A guide oligonucleotide often comprises a nucleic acid sequence that is 80% to 100% identical to the target site.  A guide oligonucleotide is sometimes a nucleic acid that is 18 to 30 bases in length.  Without being limited totheory, an ANAGO described herein can utilize a guide oligonucleotide to cut the genomic DNA of an organism or cell at a specific target sequence that is defined by the sequence of a guide oligonucleotide.  In certain embodiments, an ANAGO cleaves atarget nucleic acid sequence anywhere within a sequence defined by a guide oligonucleotide.  In some embodiments, an ANAGO cleaves a target site at a location defined by any one of the first 10 nucleotides (5'-nucleotides) of a guide oligonucleotide. When both a guide oligonucleotide and a donor nucleic acid are present, an ANAGO will proceed to replace the targeted sequence with a donor nucleic acid into the genome of a cell at a target site defined by the guide oligonucleotide.  If a donor sequenceis not present, an ANAGO loaded with a guide oligonucleotide, will often cleave a target site defined by the guide oligonucleotide sequence.  This process often results in the introduction of one or more single nucleotide mutations introduced at thetarget site (e.g., see Example 3)."", 'In some embodiments, there are several advantages to not using a guide molecule in the ANAGO induced precise genomic sequence editing (AISE) technology disclosed herein.  First, the percentages of on-target HDR precise editing using the AISE inthe presence of a guide molecule and a donor molecule is lower than that of the AISE in the presence of a donor molecule alone without a guide molecule.  The difference in the percentages of on-target HDR precise editing between the AISE with a guidemolecule and the AISE without a guide molecule can be significant.  In some embodiments, the percentages of on-target HDR precise editing using AISE in the presence of a guide molecule and a donor molecule is about 1-10 times, about 1-6 times, about 1-5times, about 1-4 times, about 1-3 times, about 1 times, about 2 times, about 3 times, about 4 times, about 5 times, about 6 times, about 7 times, about 8 times, about 9 times, about 10 times, about 1%-40%, about 1%-30%, about 1%-20%, about 1%-10%, about10%-20%, about 20%-30%, about 1%-5%, about 1%-4%, about 1%-3%, about 1%-2%, about 2%-3%, about 3%-4%, about 4%-5%, about 5%-6%, about 6%-7%, about 7%-8%, about 8%-9%, about 9%-10%, about 10%-15%, about 15%-20%, about 20%-25%, about 25%-30%, about 5%-10%,about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 3.2%, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 15.3%, or about 20% lower than that of the AISE in the presence of a donor molecule alone without a guide molecule, or any percentage bounded by any of the above values.  Itis possible that the guide molecule in the AISE described herein may compete with the donor molecule during the sequence editing.  Therefore, not only is a guide molecule not required for ANAGO induced precise genomic sequence editing (AISE), but theremay also be an advantage in not using a guide molecule in the AISE described herein in achieving precise genomic editing with high yield/percentage.', 'Furthermore, to prepare a guide molecule that is specific to each given target sequence and to incorporate the guide molecule in AISE requires additional material, synthesis time, purification time, and steps.  This may be more time consumingand inconvenient, which would certainly increase overall treatment cost and prolong the overall treatment time when AISE is applied in gene therapy for treating gene related various diseases, disorders, or conditions.', ""A donor sequence (a donor fragment) is a nucleic acid comprising three parts, a 5' flanking sequence, a desired sequence, and a 3' flanking sequence.

Construction of Human ANAGO', 'The ability to introduce a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene, heterologous DNA or modified nucleic acid) into a genome of an organism at a specific targeted locus is a powerful tool for therapeutic and research purposes.  The user-friendly CRISPR-Cas9is very efficient in making mutations via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in human cancer cell lines such as 293T cells.  However, it can mediate homologous recombination (HR) only at a much low efficiency (2-5%) in 293T cells and even lower in otherbiologically relevant cells such as human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  Gao et al. in a retracted publication (Gao F, et al., (2016) Nat.  Biotechnol.  34(7):768-73) reported that it is feasible to achieve genome editing in human cells byusing Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) with a guide DNA oligo.  However, multiple labs have failed to reproduce this phenomenon claimed by Gao et al. thus far, which led to the withdrawal of this publication later by Gao et al. Gao et al. usethe sequence of the NgAgo in their publication.', 'To investigate whether the ANAGO described herein could be used as a novel and practical gene editing tool in mammalian cells, we reasoned that it is plausible for microbial argonaute proteins to mediate gene editing in human cells, but at avery low efficiency to be detectable.  Particularly, since most of reported DNA targeting argonaute proteins are the products of either bacterial or archaeal microorganisms, their preference of codon usage is significantly different from the ones used inthe translation machinery of human cells.  It is known that codon usage is a rate-limiting factor for efficient translation and proper folding of a protein in an organism-specific manner.  Therefore, we reengineered and adapted the DNA coding sequencesof microbial argonaute proteins that have DNA endonuclease activities in microbial cells, such as NgAgo, PfAgo, TtAgo and MjAgo, with the codons that are most frequently used in human cells (as described above), to generate humanized argonaute variants,that comprises, conserves, and/or retains an ability to edit a target nucleic acid sequence within a human cell when expressed in the human cell.  We name this type of reengineered and adapted argonaute variant ""ANAGO"".  ANAGO is species-specific.  WhenANAGO comprises the codons that are preferentially used in human cells, we call it human ANAGO.', 'In order to introduce the ANAGO into the nucleus of mammalian cells, we fused a SV40 nuclear localization signal peptide sequence (NLS) to the N-terminus of the protein in ANAGO.  A small Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was also includedfor protein detection purposes.

HEK293 (ATCC catalog # CRL-1573) cells were maintained in a DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin.  Cells were seeded into 12-wellplates one day before transfection.  Cells were transfected at about 50% confluence using LIPOFECTAMINE.TM.  3000 (Thermo Scientific).  Specifically, HEK293 were transfected with 1000 ng of a human ANAGO-expressing plasmid plus certain amount of donorDNA fragment that is dependent on its size (for examples, 240 ng of 1.8 kb PCSK9-mCherry knock-in fragment or 200 nM of single-stranded oligonucleotide PCSK9 R104C-V114A 70mer for PCSK9 gene in example 1, see FIG. 1a).  Cells were harvested for genomicDNA extraction 72 hours post transfection.  The donor fragment directed genomic editing event was identified and confirmed by PCR.  Subsequently, the genomic PCR products are sequenced and analyzed.', 'We have used a few human ANAGO described herein to induce homologous recombination directed genome editing in human cells successfully.  We have discovered that the use of the human ANAGO to induce genome editing in human cells does not requirethe presence of a guide DNA molecule.  ANAGO induced genome editing is highly precise and produces very low numbers of associated indel events in the target site in all cases tested.  Selected examples of using an ANAGO-induced sequence editing (AISE)technology to modify genes in human cells are shown below.', 'Example 1.  Human PCSK9', 'Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type9 (PCSK9), acts in lipoprotein homeostasis.  It binds and removes low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR).  If not binding PCSK9, LDLR will return to the cell surface and can continue to removeLDL-particles from the bloodstream.  Agents which block PCSK9 can lower LDL particle concentrations.  Significantly, individuals with complete naturally occurring heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of PCSK9 gene have a near 88% reduced risk ofdeveloping cardiovascular complications over a 15-year follow-up period [Cohen J C, Boerwinkle E, et al, 2006, NEJM 354:1264-1272].  Moreover, carriers of LOF mutations such as deltaR97+Y142X, C679X, and R104C+V114A were found to lack PCSK9 expression. These individuals with natural occurring LOF mutations have very low LDL levels in their blood stream without association with any obvious deleterious effects.  This supports the clinical utility of introducing LOF mutations to PCSK9 through gene editingto treat hypercholesterolemia.', ""To test if ANAGO induced sequence editing (AISE) technology described herein could be used to introduce specific PCSK9 LOF mutations in mammalian cells, we first constructed a donor molecule via fusion PCR, which contains the mCherry codingsequence flanked by the homology regions to the exon 1 and intron 1 sequence of PCSK9 gene on the left and right sides respectively.  The homology directed replacement (HDR) of the mCherry fragment removes the entire exon 1 as well as 88 bps of theintron 1 sequence of PCSK9 (FIG. 1a).  The protein expression constructs of human ANAGO (NLS-NgAgo ORF, HA-NLS-PfAgo ORF, and HA-NLS-TtAgo ORF) and the donor molecule were co-transfected into HEK293 either with or without a guide oligo PCSK9-GD8S(5'-TGGGTCCCGCGGGCGCCCGTGCGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 7)) that targets exon 1 by using LIPOFECTAMINE.TM.  3000.  The cellular genomic DNA was harvested at 72 hours post transfection.  PCR of genomic DNA samples was carried out to identify the mCherry knock-inevent by pairing a donor mCherry specific primer (mCherry-For: 5'-CCTTTCCCACAACGAGGACT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 8)) with a flanking region of PCSK9 specific primer (PCSK9-in1-R3: 5'-CGAGAATACCTCCGCCCCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 9)), which is located outside of the righthomology arm (FIG. 1b).  The genomic PCR product was only detectable from the cell samples that were transfected with an ANAGO expression construct and the 1.8 kb of mCherry KI donor fragment either with or without the guide oligo, but not in the absenceof the donor fragment (FIG. 1b)."", 'In a separate experimental setting, instead of using an over 500 bps long and double stranded homologous sequence as a flanking arm to facilitate HDR, we tested whether a short and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide, PCSK9 R104C-V114A 70mer', ""TABLE-US-00004 (5'-CCTGCAGGCCCAGGCTGCC GCCGGGGATACCTCACCAAGATCCTG CATG CTTCCATGGCCTTCTTCCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 5)),"", ""which mimics R104C (CGC>TGC)+V114A (GTC>GCC) LOF mutant allele sequence of human PCSK9 gene, could be used as a donor template.  The mutated bases are located at the 20th and 40th positions of the 70mer respectively.

TtAgo bound with 5'-phosphorylated single-stranded DNA guide (13-25 nucleotides in length),effectively cleaved a foreign complementary DNA in vivo.  Previously, we were among the pioneers who had utilized gene swamping experiments to demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved proteins, such as homeodomain-containing proteins, were not onlyconserved in structures, but also could functionally act in a similar fashion in a species that was diverged from a common ancestor over millions of years ago (Zhao J J, Lazzarini R A, Pick L.

The body produces thick and sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and obstruct the pancreas.  Cystic fibrosis can be life-threatening, and people with thecondition tend to have a shorter-than-normal life span.  Cystic Fibrosis is caused by any one or combination of numerous mutations affecting the function of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR).  Currently, there is no cure forthe disease, but the symptoms can be mitigated through therapy.  Mutations can affect different parts of the pathway thereby leading to distinct natural history and calling for unique therapies.  In all cases, gene-editing to correct the mutation beforea child is born would greatly increase the quality of life of the future child.  Under the responsible ethical guidance, the AISE technology would be a method of choice for gene-editing in these cases because it can work easily in germ cells orfertilized eggs, has minimal off-target effects, and can easily correct simple mutations via homologous recombination.  For example, if a set of germ cells or fertilized eggs are sequenced in vitro and found to have the F508del mutation, the CFTRmisfolding that would be expected to occur can be reverted to normal form by using ANAGO mediated precise gene-editing technology.', 'Optogenetics', 'Optogenetics is a research tool that is commonly found in neuroscience laboratories.

Viral vehicles are typically used to deliver the gene engineering tool tointroduce the channel Rhodopsin, flanked by a promoter, to the cell types of interest.  In this case, ANAGO in a form of RNA could be placed in the viral capsid and injected into the portion of the mouse brain that is under study.  The geneticengineering can also be done upstream in the germline cells of an animal model, and application for which AISE technology would equally be well-suited.  A probe with the capability of delivering targeted beams of light is then inserted into the animalbrain (a probe containing an optic fiber, commonly).  Once the rig is cemented in place, researchers can toggle the light between on and off and change the activity of the neurons in different settings, environments, and in the presence of novel stimuli.

On the other hand, the disruption of particular genes in the tissuemay also have a beneficial effect.  For example, reducing PCSK9 activity is correlated with decreased LDL level.

For example, the microbiome of the GI tract underlies central processes of nutrient capture and metabolism; however, disruption of this microbiome is alsobelieved to be causative of a number of disorders.', 'Indeed, antibiotics, often a frontline therapy to prevent deleterious effects of microbes on human health, can induce disruption in the microbiome, including in the GI tract, and lead to further disease.  For instance, it is often necessary toadminister oral antibiotics for the treatment of infections.  However, residual oral antibiotics beyond what is needed for eradication of an infection can alter the ecological balance of normal intestinal microbiota in the gut and lead to furtherdisease.', 'Therefore, there is a need for agents that prevent microbiome disruption by oral antibiotics while not reducing or eradicating the beneficial anti-infective effects of these antibiotics in a subject.', 'SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION', 'Accordingly, the present invention provides compositions and methods for protecting the gastrointestinal microbiome of a subject.  In one aspect, methods for protecting the microbiome of the GI tract are provided in which an effective amount ofa pharmaceutical composition comprising a beta-lactamase is administered to a subject who is undergoing treatment of has recently undergone treatment with an oral antibiotic, wherein the beta-lactamase is capable of deactivating the oral antibiotic.  Inan embodiment, the beta-lactamase does not substantially interfere with the plasma levels of a systemically absorbed orally administered antibiotic.  In another embodiment, the beta-lactamase deactivates excess oral antibiotic residue excreted into theGI tract.  In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase deactivates residual active antibiotic that is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returned in active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation.  In certainembodiments, an initial and/or adjunctive therapy may be administered to the subject.  The initial and/or adjunctive therapy may be one or more of metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, rifaximin, charcoal-based binder/adsorbent, fecal bacteriotherapy,probiotic therapy, and antibody therapy.  In certain embodiments, the subject may have previously suffered from a microbiome-mediated disorder or may present with symptoms of recurrence of a microbiome-mediated disorder.', ""In various embodiments, the methods of the invention treat or prevent a microbiome-mediated disorder, such as an antibiotic-induced adverse effect, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, C. difficile-associated disease, ulcerativecolitis, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.  In an embodiment, the methods of the invention maintain the normal intestinal microbiota of a subject.  For instance, in some embodiments, the methods of the invention maintain a healthy balance(e.g. a healthy ratio and/or healthy distribution) of intestinal microbiota of a subject.  In another embodiment, the methods of the invention treat or prevent the overgrowth of one or more pathogenic microorganisms in the GI tract.  In a furtherembodiment, the methods of the inventions find use in treating or preventing a nosocomial infection and/or a secondary emergent infection."", 'In various embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated for GI tract delivery.  For example, the beta-lactamase may be enteric coated.  In an embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract in which itdeactivates residual or excess oral antibiotic (e.g. residual active antibiotic that is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returned in active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation).  In another embodiment, thebeta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in which it prevents a microbicidal activity of the residual or excess oral antibiotic.  In a further embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract in whichit does not substantially interfere with the systemic activity of the orally administered antibiotic.  In another embodiment, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release in a location in the GI tract that is distal to the release and absorption of theorally administered antibiotic.  In various embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated for substantially uniform dissolution in the area of release in the GI tract.  In still further embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated formicroorganism-based release in the GI tract.', 'In various embodiments, methods of the present invention provide combination therapy including beta-lactamase and one or more additional therapeutic agents.  In an embodiment, a subject is administered with a beta-lactamase inhibitor thatreleases in the GI tract proximal to the beta-lactamase.', 'BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES', 'FIG. 1 shows a timeline of piglet dosing for the study of Example 1.', 'FIG. 2 shows amoxicillin levels in the pig serum from the study of Example 1.', 'FIG. 3 shows strain relative abundance percent similarity from the sequencing analysis of Example 1.

Administration of oralantibiotics often disrupts the ecological balance of normal intestinal microbiota due to residual unabsorbed antibiotics being excreted into the intestines (e.g., the distal small intestine and/or the large intestine).  Beta-lactamases inactivate theunabsorbed antibiotics in the GI tract thereby restoring and/or maintaining the normal intestinal microbiota and preventing any overgrowth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.', 'In some aspects, the present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that one or more beta-lactamases can be formulated to release in one or more locations within the GI tract at which the beta-lactamase inactivates (e.g. hydrolyzes) anorally delivered beta-lactam antibiotic and, in doing so, protects the microbiome, but the beta-lactamase does not interfere with intestinal absorption of the oral antibiotic and, accordingly, does not interfere with systemic blood or plasma levels ofthe oral antibiotic.  The invention further identifies the location of such beta-lactamase release or activation with preferred locations being in the ileum or cecum.  By way of illustration, in some embodiments, the following two approaches may beemployed separately or in combination: utilization of formulations designed to release beta-lactamase at the desired location in the GI tract and combining the antibiotic with an oral beta-lactamase inhibitor.  In the latter, in some embodiments, thebeta-lactamase inhibitor tracks with the beta-lactam antibiotic such that both are available for absorption in the proximal small intestine.  The beta-lactamase inhibitor serves to protect the beta-lactam antibiotic from the beta-lactamase in theproximal small intestine.  The antibiotic and the inhibitor are then both absorbed into the bloodstream and thereby removed from the proximal small intestine.  As the concentration of inhibitor decreases in the small intestine, the beta-lactamase becomesactive.  Any residual or excess antibiotic that remains in the intestine or reenters with the bile will is inactivated prior to encountering the colonic microbiome.', 'Beta-Lactamases and Pharmaceutical Compositions', 'The present invention is directed, in part, to pharmaceutical compositions, formulations, and uses of one or more beta-lactamases.  As used herein, a beta-lactamase refers to an enzyme, which deactivates beta-lactams.  For example, thebeta-lactamase may deactivate a beta-lactam by hydrolysis (e.g. hydrolysis of residual or excess antibiotic).  Hydrolysis of the amide bond of the beta-lactam ring by the beta-lactamase makes an antimicrobial agent such as an antibiotic biologicallyinactive.', 'In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to compositions including one or more beta-lactamase enzyme of class EC 3.5.2.6.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, Group 1 beta-lactamases includecephalosporinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid; Group 2 includes penicillinases, cephalosporinases and broad-spectrum beta-lactamases that are generally inhibited by active site-directed beta-lactamase inhibitors; Group 3 includesmetallo-beta-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, and that are poorly inhibited by almost all beta-lactam-containing molecules; and Group 4 includes penicillinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid.', 'In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase is a class A, B, C, or D beta-lactamase, in accordance with the Ambler classification which divides beta-lactamases based on their amino acid sequences (Ambler 1980, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 289: 321-331; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).  Without wishing to be bound by theory, classes A, C, and D beta-lactamases include evolutionarily distinct groups of serine beta-lactamases, and class B include thezinc-dependent (""EDTA-inhibited"") beta-lactamases (see Ambler R.

However, the one or more beta-lactamase inhibitors do not have suchinhibitory effects on beta-lactamase activity lower in the GI tract (e.g. distal small intestine and/or the colon) and therefore allow the described beta-lactamase to deactivate (e.g. hydrolyze) residual or excess oral antibiotic lower in the GI tractand thus prevent or mitigate damage to the GI microbiota.', 'In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase inhibitor tracks with the beta-lactam antibiotic such that both are available for absorption in the proximal small intestine.  The beta-lactamase inhibitor serves to protect the beta-lactam antibiotic fromthe beta-lactamase in the proximal small intestine.  The antibiotic and the inhibitor are then both absorbed into the bloodstream and thereby removed from the proximal small intestine.

In one embodiment, the delayed-release coating includes an enteric agent that is substantially stable in acidic environments and substantially unstable in near neutral to alkalineenvironments.  In an embodiment, the delayed-release coating contains an enteric agent that is substantially stable in gastric fluid.  The enteric agent can be selected from, for example, solutions or dispersions of methacrylic acid copolymers, celluloseacetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, and EUDRAGIT.RTM.-type polymer (poly(methacrylic acid, methylmethacrylate), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, celluloseacetate trimellitate, shellac or other suitable enteric coating polymers.

The enteric agent may be a combination of the foregoing solutions or dispersions.', 'In one embodiment, the modified-release formulation may include one or more delayed-release coating(s) which remain essentially intact, or may be essentially insoluble, in gastric fluid.  The stability of the delayed-release coating can be pHdependent.  Delayed-release coatings that are pH dependent will be substantially stable in acidic environments (pH of about 5 or less), and substantially unstable in near neutral to alkaline environments (pH greater than about 5).  For example, thedelayed-release coating may essentially disintegrate or dissolve in near neutral to alkaline environments such as are found in the small intestine (e.g. one or more of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) and/or large intestine (e.g. one or more of thececum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon).', 'By way of non-limiting example, there are various EUDRAGIT formulations that dissolve at rising pH, with formulations that dissolve at pH>5.5 (EUDRAGIT L30 D-550), pH>6.0 (EUDRAGIT L12, 5), and pH>7.0 (EUDRAGIT FS 30D).  Since the ileumhas the highest pH in the small intestine, ranging from 7.3 to 7.8, the use of EUDRAGIT FS 30D to coat the pellet containing the antibiotic-degrading enzyme, may delay the dissolution of the pellet until it reaches the ileum thereby localizing therelease of the antibiotic-degrading enzyme to the ileum.  However, the jejunum has a pH ranging from 6.6 to 7.4, therefore, the release may initiate in some patients in the jejunum, if the pH is at 7.0 or above.  In such embodiments, theantibiotic-degrading enzyme may be delivered with an antibiotic/inhibitor combination as described.  The different types of EUDRAGIT can be combined with each other, or multiple different types of EUDRAGIT coatings can be combined to fine tune thedissolution profile to achieve targeted delivery to achieve optimal function.  For example, EUDRAGIT L100, EUDRAGIT S100, and triethyl citrate may be mixed together at a ratio of, for example, about 72.7/18.2/9.1, to form a coating that substantiallyreleases at a pH of greater than about 6.2.  In another example, EUDRAGIT L100, EUDRAGIT S100, and triethyl citrate may be mixed together at a ratio of, for example, about 30/60.9/9, to form a coating that substantially releases at a pH of greater thanabout 6.7.  In a further example, DUOCOAT (KUECEPT) that uses two coatings of enteric polymers (like EUDRAGIT), an outer layer, and an inner layer of partially neutralized enteric polymer and a buffer agent.  The DUOCOAT technology allows more rapidrelease of the therapeutic agent initiated at the targeted pH compared to a single coating of the enteric polymer (Liu et al., 2010, European J. Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceuticals 47:311, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein byreference).  Release was demonstrated to be targeted to the ileum and/or ileoceacal junction in 10 healthy volunteers (Varum et al., 2013, European J. Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceuticals 84:573, the entire contents of all of which are incorporatedherein by reference).', 'In another embodiment, the delayed-release coating may degrade as a function of time when in aqueous solution without regard to the pH and/or presence of enzymes in the solution.  Such a coating may comprise a water insoluble polymer.  Itssolubility in aqueous solution is therefore independent of the pH.  The term ""pH independent"" as used herein means that the water permeability of the polymer and its ability to release pharmaceutical ingredients is not a function of pH and/or is onlyvery slightly dependent on pH.  Such coatings may be used to prepare, for example, sustained release formulations.  Suitable water insoluble polymers include pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic polymers that are substantially insoluble in aqueousmedia, e.g., water, independent of the pH of the solution.  Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, or cellulose ether-esters, i.e., a cellulose derivative in which some of the hydroxy groups on thecellulose skeleton are substituted with alkyl groups and some are modified with alkanoyl groups.  Examples include ethyl cellulose, acetyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, and the like.  Other examples of insoluble polymers include, but are not limited to,lacquer, and acrylic and/or methacrylic ester polymers, polymers or copolymers of acrylate or methacrylate having a low quaternary ammonium content, or mixture thereof and the like.  Other examples of insoluble polymers include EUDRAGIT RS.RTM., EUDRAGITRL.RTM., and EUDRAGIT NE.RTM..  Insoluble polymers useful in the present invention include polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl acetals, polyacrylic acid esters, butadiene styrene copolymers, and the like.  In one embodiment, colonic delivery is achieved by useof a slowly-eroding wax plug (e.g., various PEGS, including for example, PEG6000) or pectin.  In an embodiment, the present invention contemplates the use of a delayed-release coating that degrade as a function of time which comprises a swell layercomprising croscarmellos sodium and hydroxyproplycellulose.  In such embodiment, the formulation may further include an osmotic rupture coating that comprises ethylcellulose such as ethylcellulose dispersions.', 'Alternatively, the stability of the modified-release formulation can be enzyme-dependent.  Delayed-release coatings that are enzyme dependent will be substantially stable in fluid that does not contain a particular enzyme and substantiallyunstable in fluid containing the enzyme.  The delayed-release coating will essentially disintegrate or dissolve in fluid containing the appropriate enzyme.  Enzyme-dependent control can be brought about, for example, by using materials which release theactive ingredient only on exposure to enzymes in the intestine, such as galactomannans.  Also, the stability of the modified-release formulation can be dependent on enzyme stability in the presence of a microbial enzyme present in the gut flora.  Forexample, in various embodiments, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a microbial enzyme present in the gut flora.  In an embodiment, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a bacteria present in the small intestine.  In anotherembodiment, the delayed-release coating may be degraded by a bacteria present in the large intestine.', 'In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations of the present invention are designed for immediate release (e.g. upon ingestion).  In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations may have sustained-release profiles, i.e.slow release of the active ingredient(s) in the body (e.g., GI tract) over an extended period of time.  In various embodiments, the modified-release formulations may have a delayed-release profile, i.e. not immediately release the active ingredient(s)upon ingestion; rather, postponement of the release of the active ingredient(s) until the composition is lower in the gastrointestinal tract; for example, for release in the small intestine (e.g., one or more of duodenum, jejunum, ileum) or the largeintestine (e.g., one or more of cecum, ascending, transverse, descending or sigmoid portions of the colon, and rectum).  For example, a composition can be enteric coated to delay release of the active ingredient(s) until it reaches the small intestine orlarge intestine.  In some embodiments, there is not a substantial amount of the active ingredient(s) of the present formulations in the stool.', 'In various embodiments, the modified release formulation is designed for release in the colon.  Various colon-specific delivery approaches may be utilized.  For example, the modified release formulation may be formulated using a colon-specificdrug delivery system (CODES) as described for example, in Li et al., AAPS PharmSciTech (2002), 3(4): 1-9, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  Drug release in such a system is triggered by colonic microflora coupled withpH-sensitive polymer coatings.  For example, the formulation may be designed as a core tablet with three layers of polymer.  The first coating is an acid-soluble polymer (e.g., EUDRAGIT E), the outer coating is enteric, along with an hydroxypropylmethylcellulose barrier layer interposed in between.  In another embodiment, colon delivery may be achieved by formulating the beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) with specific polymers that degrade in the colon such as, for example,pectin.  The pectin may be further gelled or crosslinked with a cation such as a zinc cation.  In an embodiment, the formulation is in the form of ionically crosslinked pectin beads which are further coated with a polymer (e.g., EUDRAGIT polymer). Additional colon specific formulations include, but are not limited to, pressure-controlled drug delivery systems (prepared with, for example, ethylcellulose) and osmotic controlled drug delivery systems (i.e., ORDS-CT).', 'Formulations for colon specific delivery of beta-lactamases (and/or additional therapeutic agents), as described herein, may be evaluated using, for example, in vitro dissolution tests.  For example, parallel dissolution studies in differentbuffers may be undertaken to characterize the behavior of the formulations at different pH levels.  Alternatively, in vitro enzymatic tests may be carried out.  For example, the formulations may be incubated in fermenters containing suitable medium forbacteria, and the amount of drug released at different time intervals is determined.  Drug release studies can also be done in buffer medium containing enzymes or rat or guinea pig or rabbit cecal contents and the amount of drug released in a particulartime is determined.  In a further embodiment, in vivo evaluations may be carried out using animal models such as dogs, guinea pigs, rats, and pigs.  Further, clinical evaluation of colon specific drug delivery formulations may be evaluated by calculatingdrug delivery index (DDI) which considers the relative ratio of RCE (relative colonic tissue exposure to the drug) to RSC (relative amount of drug in blood i.e. that is relative systemic exposure to the drug).  Higher drug DDI indicates better colon drugdelivery.  Absorption of drugs from the colon may be monitored by colonoscopy and intubation.', 'In various embodiments, the present formulation provide for substantial uniform dissolution of the beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) in the area of release in the GI tract.  In an embodiment, the present formulation minimizespatchy or heterogeneous release of the beta-lactamase.  For example, when releasing in the distal small intestine or, especially the colon, the distribution of beta-lactamase (and/or additional therapeutic agent) may be heterogeneous and thereforerequire formulation to minimize local effects.', 'In some embodiments, a dual pulse formulation is provided.  In various embodiments, the present invention provides for modified-release formulations that release multiple doses of the beta-lactamase, at different locations along the intestines,at different times, and/or at different pH.  In an illustrative embodiment, the modified-release formulation comprises a first dose of the beta-lactamase and a second dose of the beta-lactamase, wherein the first dose and the second dose are released atdifferent locations along the intestines, at different times, and/or at different pH.  For example, the first dose is released at the duodenum, and the second dose is released at the ileum.  In another example, the first dose is released at the jejunum,and the second dose is released at the ileum.  In other embodiments, the first dose is released at a location along the small intestine (e.g., the duodenum), while the second dose is released along the large intestine (e.g., the ascending colon).  Invarious embodiments, the modified-release formulation may release at least one dose, at least two doses, at least three doses, at least four doses, at least five doses, at least six doses, at least seven doses, or at least eight doses of thebeta-lactamase at different locations along the intestines, at different times, and/or at different pH.  Further the dual pulse description herein applies to modified-release formulations that release a beta-lactamase and an additional therapeutic agent.', 'In some embodiments, a dual pulse formulation is provided in which a dose of the beta-lactamase and a dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) are released at different locations along the intestines, at different times,and/or at different pH.  For example, the dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) is released proximal to the dose of the beta-lactamase.  For example, the dose of an oral antibiotic (and/or a beta-lactamase inhibitor) is releasedin the ileum and upstream and the dose of the beta-lactamase is released in the distal small intestine and/or the colon.', 'In various embodiments, the invention provides a formulation comprising: a core particle having a base coat comprising one or more beta-lactamases, and a delayed-release coating disposed over the coated core particle.

In one embodiment, one or more doses of the beta-lactamase may be encapsulated in a core particle, for example, in the formof a microsphere or a mini-sphere.  For example, the beta-lactamase may be combined with a polymer (e.g., latex), and then formed into a particulate, micro-encapsulated enzyme preparation, without using a sucrose core.  The microspheres or mini-spheresthus formed may be optionally covered with a delayed-release coating.', 'A variety of approaches for generating particulates (such as microspheres, mini-spheres, aggregates, other) may be utilized for the inclusion of enzymatic proteins.  They typically involve at least two phases, one containing the protein, and onecontaining a polymer that forms the backbone of the particulate.  Most common are coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water(w/o/w) emulsion where the inner water phase contains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form, forexample, microspheres or mini-spheres.  Alternatively, the beta-lactamase and stabilizing excipients (for example, trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol) are combined and sprayed from aqueous solution and collected.  The particles are thensuspended in a dry, water immiscible organic solvent containing polymer and release modifying compounds, and the suspension sonicated to disperse the particles.  An additional approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.  Specifically, theenzymatic protein, buffer components, a polymer latex, and stabilizing and release-modifying excipients are dissolved/dispersed in water.  The aqueous dispersion is spray-dried, leading to coalescence of the latex, and incorporation of the protein andexcipients in particles of the coalesced latex.  When the release modifiers are insoluble at acidic conditions but soluble at higher pHs (such as carboxylic acid) then release from the matrix is inhibited in the gastric environment.  In an embodiment,the beta-lactamase may be initially solubilized as an emulsion, microemulsion, or suspension and then formulated into solid mini-spheres or microspheres.  The formulation may then be coated with, for example, a delayed-release, sustained-release, orcontrolled-release coating to achieve delivery at a specific location such as, for example, the intestines.', 'In various embodiments, the formulation may comprise a plurality of modified-release particles or beads or pellets or microspheres.

The separating layer essentially separates the coated core particle from the delayed-release coating.', 'The separating layer can be applied to the coated core particle by coating or layering procedures typically used with coating equipment such as a coating pan, coating granulator or in a fluidized bed apparatus using water and/or organic solventsfor the coating process.  As an alternative the separating layer can be applied to the core material by using a powder coating technique.  The materials for separating layers are pharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as, for instance, sugar,polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl-cellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium and others, used alone or in mixtures.  Additivessuch as plasticizers, colorants, pigments, fillers, anti-tacking and anti-static agents, such as for instance magnesium stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, titanium dioxide, talc and other additives can also be included in the separating layer.', 'In some embodiments, the coated particles with the delayed-release coating may be further covered with an overcoat layer.  The overcoat layer can be applied as described for the other coating compositions.  The overcoat materials arepharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as sugar, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodiumand others, used alone or in mixtures.  The overcoat materials can prevent potential agglomeration of particles coated with the delayed-release coating, protect the delayed-release coating from cracking during the compaction process or enhance thetableting process.', 'In various embodiments, the formulation may comprise a plurality of modified-release particles or pellets or microspheres.

The microspheres then may be covered with a pH-dependent entericcoating.  In some embodiments, no sucrose core is required and this allows for higher drug loading per pellet and therefore a smaller capsule size for therapy.  There are a variety of approaches for generating particulates (such as microspheres,aggregates, other) that are amenable to the inclusion of proteins.  In some embodiments, the approaches involve at least two phases, one containing the protein, and one containing a polymer that forms the backbone of the particulate.  For example, one ormore of the following may be used: coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water (w/o/w) emulsion where the inner water phasecontains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form the microspheres.', 'In some embodiments, the protein and stabilizing excipients (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol) are combined and then the mixture is sprayed from aqueous solution and particles that are formed are collected.  The particlesare then suspended in a dry, water immiscible organic solvent containing polymer and release modifying compounds, and the suspension sonicated to disperse the particles.  It is anticipated that the enzyme will retain its activity following this process. Another approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.  Here, the enzyme, buffer components, a polymer latex, and stabilizing and release-modifying excipients are dissolved/dispersed in water.  The aqueous dispersion is spray-dried, leading tocoalescence of the latex, and incorporation of the protein and excipients in particles of the coalesced latex.  If the release modifiers are insoluble at acidic conditions but soluble at higher pHs (such as carboxylic acidic) then release from the matrixshould be inhibited in the gastric environment.', 'In various embodiments, the formulations of the present invention take the form of those as described in U.S.  Provisional Patent Application No. 62/061,507, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.', 'In various embodiments, the formulations of the present invention take the form of those as described in one or more of U.S.  Pat.

In some embodiments, the beta-lactamase is formulated for release by a genetically-modified microorganism, optionally selected fromfungi, bacteria, and algae.  In some embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism is resistant to one or more oral antibiotic.  For example, the invention may pertain to a genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamasesthat is formulated for GI tract delivery as described herein and that releases the beta-lactamases, e.g. by secretion.  For example, a genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases may be formulated for release in the distalsmall intestine and/or colon and, when released, in turn, secretes or otherwise releases (e.g. via genetically-modified microorganism death or digestion) the beta-lactamase so it may eliminate residual or excess oral antibiotic (e.g. active antibioticthat is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returned in active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation) and prevent GI tract microbiota disruption.', 'In various embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases is formulated so as to deliver viable recombinant yeast cells to the intestines where active beta-lactamases are secreted by thegenetically-modified microorganisms.  In one embodiment, the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases is formulated as an enteric-coated capsule which directly releases the recombinant genetically-modified microorganismin the intestines.  In other embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases can be formulated as a gelatin capsule, or the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases can bedissolved in a liquid and ingested.  In such embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases is delivered anywhere along the GI tract.  As described herein, the genetically-modified microorganism comprising oneor more beta-lactamases can be released in the distal small intestine and/or the colon; however, delivery anywhere in the GI tract is also imagined, for example, where the genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases is ableto transit to the area of interest without loss of activity or disruption of the systemic activity of the oral antibiotics.  By way of illustration, in some embodiments, a recombinant yeast cell, for example, Saccharomyces boulardii, is resistant tostomach acid and remains viable during transit to the intestine, where it secretes active beta-lactamases for neutralizing residual or excess oral antibiotic (e.g. active antibiotic that is not absorbed from the GI tract after an oral dose or is returnedin active form to the intestinal tract from the systemic circulation) in the lower GI tract.', 'In some embodiments, genetically-modified microorganism comprising one or more beta-lactamases quickly transits through the small intestine but transits slowly in the colon and therefore remains in the colon longer and any beta lactamase itsecretes or releases concentrates in the colon.', 'In some embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism is a yeast cell.  In various embodiments, the yeast cell is selected from Saccharomyces spp., Hansenula spp., Kluyveromyces spp.  Schizzosaccharomyces spp.  Zygosaccharoinyces spp.,Pichia spp., Monascus spp., Geotrichum spp.  and Yarrowia spp.  In various embodiments, the present invention contemplates expression of a beta-lactamase in a recombinant yeast cell.  The recombinant yeast cell may be generated by stable integration intoyeast chromosomal DNA of expression cassette(s) that encode and can express the one or more beta-lactamases.  Alternatively, recombinant yeast cell may be generated using a process in which the yeast maintains an expression cassette(s) that encode andcan express the one or more beta-lactamases on a stable episome.  The recombinant yeast cell may be any yeast cell that is capable of surviving in the mammalian intestine.

It has been used for the prevention and thetreatment of diarrheal diseases, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile infection (reviewed by Kelesidis and Pothoulakis, 2012; Hatoum et al., 2012).  S. boulardii differs from other S. cerevasiae strains as the optimal growthtemperature of S. boulardii is 37.degree.  C. while other strains prefer lower temperatures (between 30 and 33.degree.  C.), S. boulardii is resistant to low pH and is highly tolerant to bile acids (Edwards-Ingram et al., 2007; Graff et al., 2008).  S.boulardii was demonstrated to survive the intestinal tract in humans (Klein et al., 1993) where 0.1% viable yeast was recovered in feces after a single administration of 10.sup.10 cells.  Concurrent antibiotic treatment increased recovery two-fold (Kleinet al., 1993).', 'In some embodiments, the genetically-modified microorganism is a bacterial cell.

For example, coacervation, where the polymer is made to separate from its solvent phase by addition of a third component, or multiple phase emulsions, such as water in oil in water (w/o/w)emulsion where the inner water phase contains the protein, the intermediate organic phase contains the polymer, and the external water phase stabilizers that support the w/o/w double emulsion until the solvents can be removed to form the microspheres maybe used.', 'In another approach, the protein and stabilizing excipients (e.g., hydroxyproplyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) type MF; Aquacoat (FMC), sodium stearyl fumarate; trehalose, mannitol, Tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol, and/or others) arecombined and then the mixture from aqueous solution is sprayed, particles form and are collected.  The particles are then suspended in a dry, water immiscible organic solvent containing polymer and release modifying compounds, and the suspensionsonicated to disperse the particles.  Using this method, two formulations of P3A were developed (TABLES 7 and 8).  Notably, HPMCAS-MF was used as the pore forming reagent as it is water insoluble at low pH (i.e., forms a gel), and become water soluble athigh pH.  At least 80% P3A activity was recovered after dissolution of the P3A particles made using these formulations as measured by the CENTA chromatogenic assay (TABLES 7 and 8) (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy; 45:1868).', 'TABLE-US-00019 TABLE 7 P3A formulation 1 Amt (g) Component Item in 500 ml % Total % API P3A 2.50 0.5 9.77 Pore Former HPMCAS-MF 1.67 0.3 6.53 Matrix Aquacoat (FMC) 50.00 10.1 58.62 Lube Sodium-Stearyl 0.83 0.2 3.24 Fumarate Buffer SodiumHydrogen 0.59 0.1 2.31 Phosphate Protectant Trehalose 5.00 1.0 19.54 Water 440.00 88.8 Total Water 489.85 Total Solids 25.59 100.00 Solids in Matrix 30.00 Activity Recovered 82.00', 'TABLE-US-00020 TABLE 8 P3A formulation 2 Amt (g) Component Item in 500 ml % Total % API P3A 11.25 2.30 39.37 Pore Former HPMCAS-MF 1.50 0.30 5.25 Matrix Aquacoat (FMC) 50.00 10.00 52.49 Lube Sodium-Stearyl 0.33 0.10 1.14 Fumarate Buffer SodiumHydrogen 0.50 0.10 1.75 Phosphate Protectant Trehalose 0.00 0.00 0.00 Water 437.50 87.50 Total Water 472.50 Total Solids 28.58 100.00 Solids in Matrix 30.00 Activity Recovered 80.00', 'Another approach uses aqueous phases but no organic solvent.

The hamstermodel has been referred to as ""the gold standard"" small animal model for the evaluation of the efficacy of a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against CDI.  CDI is induced in the hamsters using the following protocol.  Male GoldenSyrian hamsters, purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind.) are pretreated 5 days or 24 hours prior to infection with a single subcutaneous injection of clindamycin at 10 or 30 mg/kg to deplete the animal\'s microbiome and predispose them to C. difficileinfection.  As ampicillin is also a risk for C. difficile infection (Freeman and Wilcox, 1999; Microbes Infect.  1:377), oral Augmentin, sultamicillin, ampicillin and/or amoxicillin is used in place of clindamycin to predispose the animals to C.difficile infection.  Plasma is collected at various times prior to and after antibiotic delivery to measure antibiotic blood levels.  On the day of infection, animals are inoculated by oral gavage with 10.sup.6 C. difficile (ATCC 43255) vegetative cellsper hamster.  The C. difficile inoculum is prepared by growing the bacteria in Difco reinforced clostridial medium with 1% Oxyrase for 24 hrs under anaerobic conditions.

An aliquot of the inoculum is then serially diluted, plated on brucella agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K.sub.1 (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), and incubated anaerobically for 48 hrs inan airtight container (Pack-Anaero MGC) to determine the infection titer.  Animals are observed twice daily during the first 24 hrs post-infection and then every 2 hrs for the following 24 hrs during the acute phase of the disease, followed by twicedaily for the remainder of the study.

Briefly, the P3A coding region is codon optimized for expression in the yeast, S. cerevasiae, modified to reduced DNA homologies, and evaluated forthe presence of N-linked glycosylation sites, synthesized and cloned into the yeast expression plasmid, pD1214 (DNA 2.0) that contains the strong, constitutive TEF promoter, and a selectable URA3+ marker.  Different S. cerevasiae leader sequences thatfacilitate secretion are known and are utilized to mediate P3A secretion.  A series of S. cerevasiae secretion vectors are available which contain a panel of different leader sequences to facilitate secretion.  An exemplary secretion signal is the yeastmating factor alpha (MAT alpha) signal, which is a 89 amino acid sequence composed of the signal and the prosequence which is cleaved in the Golgi by Kex2, an endogenous yeast protease, to yield the mature, secreted protein.  The invertase and othersignal sequences are naturally cleaved during translocation and secretion of the protein by signal peptidase and do not require additional protease cleavage steps.', ""At least two strategies may be used to generate S. cerevasiae, substrain boulardii, transformants that secrete P3A.  One strategy is the production of a S. boulardii URA3 knockout strain to allow the use of the P3A expression plasmids thatcontain the URA3 selectable marker to generate transformants (non-integrated, containing the plasmids) to use in efficacy evaluation in rodents and/or pigs.  The S. boulardii URA3 knockout is generated using the CRISPR recombination system (DiCarlo etal, 2013, Nucleic Acids Res.  41:4436).  The S. boulardii strain, designation Sb48 (ATCC Product # MYA-796) submitted to ATCC by D. A. Stevens (McCullough et al., 1998; J. Clinical Microbiology, 36:2613) is used for these studies.  Three potentialwild-type Cas9 cleavage sites in the upstream region of the URA3 gene are identified and approximately 500 pb of the regions surrounding these target sites are sequenced to ensure the presence of the sites in this yeast strain.  A homology construct isdesigned that contains an approximate 10 bp region in the middle replaced by an insert that contains multiple stop codons in all frames ensuring that the first stop codon is in the URA3 reading frame.  The CRISPR system is used to create therecombination/insertion and the URA3- clones are selected on FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid) media.  5-FOA allows the selection for URA3- mutants, as an active URA3 gene (encodes orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase) converts FOA into a toxic compound causingcell death.  The selected clones are then tested to ensure that they will not grow on media without uracil.  Selected clones are sequenced to verify the expected integration.  Once the S. boulardii strain is confirmed to be URA3-, the yeast aretransformed with the P3A encoding plasmids.  Clones are identified by plating on media without uracil.  The resulting transformants are screened for secretion of P3A using SDS/PAGE.  Filtered yeast supernatants are evaluated for activity using the CENTAbeta-lactamase biological activity assay (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 45:1868)."", 'A second strategy generates stable integrants in the wild-type S. boulardii strain using a neomycin resistance gene (neo) as the selectable marker.  Without neo expression, S. boulardii is sensitive to G418.  The S. boulardii strain, designationSb48 (ATCC Product # MYA-796) submitted to ATCC by D. A. Stevens (McCullough et al., 1998; J. Clinical Microbiology, 36:2613) is used for these studies.  Integration regions are chosen based on Flagfeldt et al (2009, Yeast 26:545), where chromosomalintegration sites were screened for high level heterologous gene expression.  The integration sites that show the highest expression levels, Regions 20, 21, and 19 are sequenced in the wild-type S. boulardii strain to verify their presence.  Onceverified, a region is chosen and plasmids containing integration cassettes are designed.  The integration cassettes containing the P3A expression cassette, a neo expression cassette, at least 500 bp of homology sequence from the upstream part of theintegration region and at least 500 bp of homology sequence from the downstream part of the integration region so that the integration region is deleted via the homologous recombination event.  The wild-type S. boulardii is transformed with theintegration cassettes and clones are selected for G418 resistance.  Clones are picked, cultures grown, and supernatants screened for the presence of the P3A protein via SDS/PAGE.  Filtered yeast supernatants are evaluated for biological activity usingthe CENTA beta-lactamase biological activity assay (Bebrone et al., 2001; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemo., 45:1868).  Clones are chosen, based on protein expression levels and biological activity, and the insert is sequenced to verify the integrity ofthe integrated sequence.', 'The P3A-expressing yeast are tested in a rodent, pig, and/or dog model(s) to determine if the P3A-expressing yeast are efficacious in the degradation of an oral antibiotic/inhibitor combination or oral antibiotic alone, without affectingantibiotic absorption.

Plasma is monitored for antibiotic levels and stool is subjected to 16S RNA sequencing to monitor thediversity of the microbiome.  The efficacy of the P3A-expressing yeast are compared to control animals that receive no treatment, animals that receive the standard of care, vancomycin (20 mg/kg orally daily beginning 24 hrs after infection and continuedfor 5 days), or animals that receive both vancomycin and the yeast.  Efficacy evaluations include mortality and evaluation of C. difficile bacteria titers and/or C. difficile toxins A and B in cecal contents, at the time of death or at the end of thestudy following euthanasia.  The results may show that treatment with the oral antibiotics and the P3A yeast at one or both doses, did not affect blood levels of the antibiotic and protected the animals from CDI, indicating that the P3A expressed by theyeast degraded the antibiotic excreted into the intestine following antibiotic absorption without affecting the initial antibiotic absorption.
